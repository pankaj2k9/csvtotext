__S-Summary__

Houses built in the 1980s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials. Exposure risk is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration. Read the regulations and have testing done before work begins.

&nbsp;

__E-Summary__

__S-Why Is This Important__

The known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation, according to the EPA, are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

Asbestos-containing materials were used in many building materials between the 1930s-1990s, and are still being used today in an unregulated way. Therefore, all houses should be considered suspect for asbestos-containing materials. If the asbestos-containing building materials have deteriorated, are damaged, or otherwise disturbed by remodeling or other work in the home the material is considered friable, meaning the asbestos fibers can become airborne. At that point, everyone is at risk from long-term exposure by inhaling the fibers.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

__E-Why Is This Important__

__S-How-To__

Asbestos testing and removal are strictly regulated by either the EPA or more stringent regulations in some states.

Check your State's Department of Health website for free information regarding regulations, compliance criteria, and penalties for failing to comply.  Most also have a list of professionals authorized to test for and to remove asbestos-containing materials.

Some states allow homeowners to test for and remove small amounts of asbestos-containing materials.  Hayward Score does not recommend this.  Hire a professional so you don't accidentally put yourself and your family at risk.

If you want more information, there are excellent resources at the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/asbestos">EPA website.</a>

__S-Summary__

Houses built in the 1980s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials. Exposure risk is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration. It is important to find out if asbestos-containing materials were present and properly remediated.

__E-Summary__

__S-Why Is This Important__

According to the EPA, the known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis. Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed. However, testing can be performed after remodelling to determine if the materials contained asbestos and if abatement is needed.

__E-Why Is This Important__

__S-How-To__

You may need to do some investigation, possibly with your contractor/remodeler to determine if asbestos is/was present.

Your home may have lead-based paint and construction materials that contain asbestos

__E-External Title__

__S-External ID__

e-170

__E-External ID__

__S-Summary__

Houses built in the 1970s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Exposure is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration.  Read your local regulations and have testing done before any work begins.

__E-Summary__

__S-Why Is This Important__

Both asbestos and lead-based paint are known health hazards. The risk of exposure is low, but increases when building materials are damaged or disturbed, like during remodeling or other work.

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong> were used in many building materials between the 1930s-1990s, and are still being used today, often in an uncontrolled way. Therefore, all houses should be considered suspect for asbestos-containing materials. If the asbestos-containing building materials have deteriorated, are damaged, or otherwise disturbed the material is considered friable, meaning the asbestos fibers can become airborne. At that point everyone is at risk from long-term exposure by inhaling the fibers.

The known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation, according to the EPA, are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

<strong>Lead-based paint</strong> can be located on any painted surface in houses built before 1978, though older homes (before 1960) have a higher likelihood of lead-based paint.

Exposure can still come from paint that is deteriorated, flaking, separated, or during remodeling.  Doors, windows, and kitchen cabinets (surfaces that rub against each other or from opening and closing) are especially prone to the creation of powder and “dust” from the lead-based paint.

Lead-based paint health effects are most significant for children under 6 years old and can be permanent. According to the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead">HUD.gov Web site,</a> the effects of lead exposure may include "behavioral problems, learning disabilities, seizures and in extreme cases, death." Other symptoms may include "headaches, stomachaches, nausea, tiredness and irritability."

__E-Why Is This Important__

__S-How-To__

Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed. For safety reasons, we do not recommend that occupants do the testing or repair themselves.

Both asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint are discussed below:

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>All houses should be considered suspect when building materials are removed, disturbed, or are found to be deteriorating. Testing should be performed before materials are altered or removed.</li>
 	<li>Although in most states homeowners are allowed to conduct some testing and to remove asbestos-containing material, Hayward Score strongly advises against occupants doing this on their own as it can increase the risk of exposure.</li>
 	<li>We strongly recommend all work be performed by a licensed contractor that is certified in asbestos removal.</li>
 	<li>There are regulations for testing after the work is completed to confirming the safe removal established by EPA.</li>
 	<li>Because some states have opted for more stringent requirements you should contact your State Department of Health for relevant requirements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lead-based paint</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>If you are actively remodeling any painted area, we encourage you to “Do No Harm” and assume a home built before 1978 has lead-based paint unless the area is tested negative by an EPA Certified Lead-Based Risk Assessor.</li>
 	<li>Although occupants are allowed to test for and remove lead paint, many consumer methods of testing can be inaccurate and removal methods can increase the risk of exposure and harm. Therefore, Hayward Score advises against it.</li>
 	<li>We strongly recommend all work be performed by a licensed contractor that is certified in the EPA Renovation, Repair and Painting Program (RRP).</li>
 	<li>There are regulations for testing after the work is completed to confirming the safe removal established by EPA.</li>
 	<li>Note: Because some states have opted for more stringent requirements, contact EPA and your State Department of Health for your requirements.</li>
</ul>
If there are small children in the home we recommend having an EPA Certified Lead-Based Risk Assessment. You can also consult your pediatrician about blood lead level testing - thresholds can be found on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/default.htm">Center for Disease Control</a> website., presenting a serious health risk, especially for children.

__S-External Title__

Your home may have lead paint and construction materials that contain asbestos

__E-External Title__

__E-External ID__

__S-Summary__

Houses built in the 1940s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Exposure is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration.  Read the regulations and have testing done before work begins.

__E-Summary__

__S-Why Is This Important__

Both asbestos and lead-based paint are known health hazards. The risk of exposure is low, but increases when building materials are damaged or disturbed, like during remodeling or other work.

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong> were used in many building materials between the 1930s-1990s, and are still being used today, often in an unregulated way. Therefore, all houses should be considered suspect for asbestos-containing materials. If the asbestos-containing building materials have deteriorated, are damaged, or otherwise disturbed the material is considered friable, meaning the asbestos fibers can become airborne. At that point everyone is at risk from long-term exposure by inhaling the fibers.

Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed.

The known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation, according to the EPA, are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

<strong>Lead-based paint</strong> can be located on any painted surface in houses built before 1978, though older homes (before 1960) have a higher likelihood of lead-based paint.

Exposure can still come from paint that is deteriorated, flaking, separated, or during remodeling.  Doors, windows, and kitchen cabinets (surfaces that rub against each other or from opening and closing) are especially prone to the creation of powder and “dust” from the lead-based paint.

Lead-based paint health effects are most significant for children under 6 years old and can be permanent.  According to the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead">HUD.gov Web site,</a> the effects of lead exposure may include "behavioral problems, learning disabilities, seizures and in extreme cases, death." Symptoms may include "headaches, stomachaches, nausea, tiredness and irritability."

__E-Why Is This Important__

__S-How-To__

Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed. For safety reasons, we do not recommend that occupants do the testing or repair themselves.

Both asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint are discussed below:

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>All houses should be considered suspect when building materials are removed, disturbed, or are found to be deteriorating. Testing should be performed before materials are altered or removed.</li>
 	<li>Although in most states homeowners are allowed to conduct some testing and to remove asbestos-containing material, Hayward Score strongly advises against occupants doing this on their own as it can increase the risk of exposure.</li>
 	<li>We strongly recommend all work be performed by a licensed contractor that is certified in asbestos removal.</li>
 	<li>There are regulations for testing after the work is completed to confirming the safe removal established by EPA.</li>
 	<li>Because some states have opted for more stringent requirements you should contact your State Department of Health for relevant requirements.</li>
