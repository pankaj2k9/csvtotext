-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Houses built in the 1980s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials. Exposure risk is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration. Read the regulations and have testing done before work begins.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

The known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation, according to the EPA, are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

Asbestos-containing materials were used in many building materials between the 1930s-1990s, and are still being used today in an unregulated way. Therefore, all houses should be considered suspect for asbestos-containing materials. If the asbestos-containing building materials have deteriorated, are damaged, or otherwise disturbed by remodeling or other work in the home the material is considered friable, meaning the asbestos fibers can become airborne. At that point, everyone is at risk from long-term exposure by inhaling the fibers.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Asbestos testing and removal are strictly regulated by either the EPA or more stringent regulations in some states.

Check your State's Department of Health website for free information regarding regulations, compliance criteria, and penalties for failing to comply.  Most also have a list of professionals authorized to test for and to remove asbestos-containing materials.

Some states allow homeowners to test for and remove small amounts of asbestos-containing materials.  Hayward Score does not recommend this.  Hire a professional so you don't accidentally put yourself and your family at risk.

If you want more information, there are excellent resources at the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/asbestos">EPA website.</a>

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Houses built in the 1980s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials. Exposure risk is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration. It is important to find out if asbestos-containing materials were present and properly remediated.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

According to the EPA, the known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis. Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed. However, testing can be performed after remodelling to determine if the materials contained asbestos and if abatement is needed.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

You may need to do some investigation, possibly with your contractor/remodeler to determine if asbestos is/was present.
<ol>
 	<li>If you know there was no asbestos-containing material, then no further action is needed.</li>
 	<li>If there was asbestos-containing material, and you know it was remediated correctly and successfully, then no further action is needed.</li>
 	<li>If there was asbestos-containing material, and you don't know if it was remediated correctly and successfully, then you need to find out. If it wasn't, then you need to take action to remove residual asbestos.</li>

Your home may have lead-based paint and construction materials that contain asbestos

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-170

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Houses built in the 1970s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Exposure is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration.  Read your local regulations and have testing done before any work begins.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Both asbestos and lead-based paint are known health hazards. The risk of exposure is low, but increases when building materials are damaged or disturbed, like during remodeling or other work.

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong> were used in many building materials between the 1930s-1990s, and are still being used today, often in an uncontrolled way. Therefore, all houses should be considered suspect for asbestos-containing materials. If the asbestos-containing building materials have deteriorated, are damaged, or otherwise disturbed the material is considered friable, meaning the asbestos fibers can become airborne. At that point everyone is at risk from long-term exposure by inhaling the fibers.

The known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation, according to the EPA, are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

<strong>Lead-based paint</strong> can be located on any painted surface in houses built before 1978, though older homes (before 1960) have a higher likelihood of lead-based paint.

Exposure can still come from paint that is deteriorated, flaking, separated, or during remodeling.  Doors, windows, and kitchen cabinets (surfaces that rub against each other or from opening and closing) are especially prone to the creation of powder and “dust” from the lead-based paint.

Lead-based paint health effects are most significant for children under 6 years old and can be permanent. According to the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead">HUD.gov Web site,</a> the effects of lead exposure may include "behavioral problems, learning disabilities, seizures and in extreme cases, death." Other symptoms may include "headaches, stomachaches, nausea, tiredness and irritability."

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed. For safety reasons, we do not recommend that occupants do the testing or repair themselves.

Both asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint are discussed below:

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>All houses should be considered suspect when building materials are removed, disturbed, or are found to be deteriorating. Testing should be performed before materials are altered or removed.</li>
 	<li>Although in most states homeowners are allowed to conduct some testing and to remove asbestos-containing material, Hayward Score strongly advises against occupants doing this on their own as it can increase the risk of exposure.</li>

 	<li>There are regulations for testing after the work is completed to confirming the safe removal established by EPA.</li>
 	<li>Because some states have opted for more stringent requirements you should contact your State Department of Health for relevant requirements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Lead-based paint</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>If you are actively remodeling any painted area, we encourage you to “Do No Harm” and assume a home built before 1978 has lead-based paint unless the area is tested negative by an EPA Certified Lead-Based Risk Assessor.</li>
 	<li>Although occupants are allowed to test for and remove lead paint, many consumer methods of testing can be inaccurate and removal methods can increase the risk of exposure and harm. Therefore, Hayward Score advises against it.</li>
 	<li>We strongly recommend all work be performed by a licensed contractor that is certified in the EPA Renovation, Repair and Painting Program (RRP).</li>
 	<li>There are regulations for testing after the work is completed to confirming the safe removal established by EPA.</li>
 	<li>Note: Because some states have opted for more stringent requirements, contact EPA and your State Department of Health for your requirements.</li>
</ul>
If there are small children in the home we recommend having an EPA Certified Lead-Based Risk Assessment. You can also consult your pediatrician about blood lead level testing - thresholds can be found on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/default.htm">Center for Disease Control</a> website., presenting a serious health risk, especially for children.

Your home may have lead paint and construction materials that contain asbestos

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Houses built in the 1940s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Exposure is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration.  Read the regulations and have testing done before work begins.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Both asbestos and lead-based paint are known health hazards. The risk of exposure is low, but increases when building materials are damaged or disturbed, like during remodeling or other work.

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong> were used in many building materials between the 1930s-1990s, and are still being used today, often in an unregulated way. Therefore, all houses should be considered suspect for asbestos-containing materials. If the asbestos-containing building materials have deteriorated, are damaged, or otherwise disturbed the material is considered friable, meaning the asbestos fibers can become airborne. At that point everyone is at risk from long-term exposure by inhaling the fibers.

Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed.

The known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation, according to the EPA, are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

<strong>Lead-based paint</strong> can be located on any painted surface in houses built before 1978, though older homes (before 1960) have a higher likelihood of lead-based paint.

Exposure can still come from paint that is deteriorated, flaking, separated, or during remodeling.  Doors, windows, and kitchen cabinets (surfaces that rub against each other or from opening and closing) are especially prone to the creation of powder and “dust” from the lead-based paint.

Lead-based paint health effects are most significant for children under 6 years old and can be permanent.  According to the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead">HUD.gov Web site,</a> the effects of lead exposure may include "behavioral problems, learning disabilities, seizures and in extreme cases, death." Symptoms may include "headaches, stomachaches, nausea, tiredness and irritability."

Your home may have lead paint and construction materials that contain asbestos
Test for Asbestos and Lead-based paint before remodeling your pre-1920's house

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-230

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Houses built in prior to the 1920s have an increased risk of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Exposure is slight unless materials are disturbed during remodeling, renovation, or water damage restoration.  Read the regulations and have testing done before work begins.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Both asbestos and lead-based paint are known health hazards. The risk of exposure is low, but increases when building materials are damaged or disturbed, like during remodeling or other work.

<strong>Asbestos-containing materials</strong> were used in many building materials between the 1930s-1990s, and are still being used today, often in an unregulated way. Therefore, all houses should be considered suspect for asbestos-containing materials. If the asbestos-containing building materials have deteriorated, are damaged, or otherwise disturbed the material is considered friable, meaning the asbestos fibers can become airborne. At that point everyone is at risk from long-term exposure by inhaling the fibers.

Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed.

The known health effects of asbestos exposure from inhalation, according to the EPA, are lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

<strong>Lead-based paint</strong> can be located on any painted surface in houses built before 1978, though older homes (before 1960) have a higher likelihood of lead-based paint.

Exposure can still come from paint that is deteriorated, flaking, separated, or during remodeling.  Doors, windows, and kitchen cabinets (surfaces that rub against each other or from opening and closing) are especially prone to the creation of powder and “dust” from the lead-based paint.

Lead-based paint health effects are most significant for children under 6 years old and can be permanent.  According to the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/healthyhomes/lead">HUD.gov Web site,</a> the effects of lead exposure may include "behavioral problems, learning disabilities, seizures and in extreme cases, death." Symptoms may include "headaches, stomachaches, nausea, tiredness and irritability."

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Because the risk of exposure can be created by remodeling or renovation, testing should be performed before materials are altered, removed, or otherwise disturbed. For safety reasons, we do not recommend that occupants do the testing or repair themselves.

Both asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint are discussed below:

Continue to stay on top of routine repairs and maintenance to maintain the structural integrity of your home, limit excess moisture, and minimize the possibility of pest intrusion.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Ongoing maintenance is key to a healthy and well-performing home.  By keeping your home structurally sound, free of pests, and without excess moisture, you minimize the possibility of conditions arising that can impact your health.  Keeping up on routine maintenance tasks also helps to keep small problems from becoming large repairs.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

When thinking about maintenance for your home, you need to consider the exterior, the interior, and the mechanical systems. Some tasks need to be done seasonally others only every decade. Depending on usage, you may find certain things in your home need more attention than others so it is important to pay attention to any changes that you notice.  Four quick things everyone can do:

1) Maintain the recommended Action Items you've completed. Keep your Score high!

2) Walk the exterior of your home mid-summer to evaluate the siding/cladding/windows for any deterioration. This allows time to caulk and maintain conditions before winter;

2) Have your heating and cooling system serviced at least annually;

3) Replace air filters in your furnace/air handler on a regular schedule as suggested by the manufacturer or more frequently if needed.

Evaluate and correct any area where water pools against your foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground), either from rain, snowmelt, or downspout drainage or hits the exterior of your house from sprinklers.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

The poor drainage at the perimeter of your house and foundation can lead to significant structural issues and be a direct source of moisture into your home, resulting in mold and bacterial growth, both of which can impact health. Damp conditions can also increase the possibility of pest infestation. Keeping your foundation free from pooling water is important to maintain structural integrity and minimize the risk of health issues.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your home is well maintained and keeping it maintained is the key to avoiding large repairs. Pay attention to the areas where you notice water pooling against the exterior of your home, an often overlooked source of moisture issues inside the home. It is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best to evaluate the exterior in the spring and fall, but it can be done other times during the year weather permitting.</span>

It is important to prevent water from accumulating against your foundation, where it can soak below the surface where it can migrate through small cracks in the foundation or soak up from below the foundation into a crawlspace. We recommend walking the perimeter of the foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground) and make sure the ground slopes at least 6 feet away with a 2 foot drop.
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure roof drainage or gutter downspouts drain at least 3 feet from the foundation.</li>
 	<li>Have gutters installed, if you don't have them. If you have them, make sure they are cleaned prior to the rainy season starts.</li>
 	<li>Fill in low spots and be sure ground slopes away from the house. Keep plants away from the side of the house.</li>
 	<li>Move sprinklers so the water does not hit the exterior walls of the house.</li>
 	<li>Make sure landscaping does not trap moisture around the foundation.</li>

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Reducing the amount of air that circulates between attached or underground garages and the living space can reduce exposure to pollutants and other hazards often present in garage air.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Garage air typically contains dust, dampness, fumes of gasoline and oil, stored chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides, various fumes from cars and car engines, including carbon monoxide.  Exposure isn't healthy for anyone and can severely affect those with asthma, respiratory conditions or chemical intolerance. Carbon monoxide, in particular, can be deadly.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Reduce the air circulation between the garage and the living space of the home.
<ul>
 	<li>Install an automatic door closer on all connecting doors between living spaces and attached garages.</li>
 	<li>Install and maintain weather-stripping on the door(s).</li>
 	<li>Store pesticides, fertilizers, gasoline, and other chemicals in a location outside of the house, including outside of the garage. Download the Chemical Storage Action Plan for details.</li>
 	<li>Install an exhaust fan on a timer which is also triggered by the opening and closing of the garage door to reduce the accumulation of car odors.</li>
 	<li>Seal the enclosure for the forced air system - but include outside combustion make-up air - to keep the garage air from being sucked into the system and blown throughout the house. For more information, download the Forced Air Action Plan.</li>

Are you changing the filter in your air purifier? Do you know they have one?

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

The filters in your room air purifier need to be changed periodically to maintain efficiency and good indoor air quality.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Air cleaners cannot sufficiently remove particles from the air if they are clogged from too much dust. The increased resistance to the airflow slows down the removal of more dust, it wears out the motor prematurely, begins to pull dust through the filter and back into the room, plus increases the risk of the growth of bacteria on the filter itself. In humid climates, mold can begin growing on the filters.

Air cleaners address these problems by the use of multiple filters within the air cleaning machine. There is  one or more pre-filters followed by a final filter - usually a HEPA filter. The pre-filters remove the visible dust and a portion of the dust too small to see. The main, or HEPA, filter removes the fine and ultra-fine particles.

These ultra-fine particles are the ones that are the most important to remove, because they are small enough to pass through the nose hairs and sinus passages, eventually lodging in the bottom of the tiniest air sacs (alvioli) in the lungs. These ultra-fine particles can irritate and inflame the lungs, trigger asthma, and intensify other respiratory diseases such as COPD. There is increasing evidence that some particles are small enough to transfer into the blood stream (along with the oxygen) and are associated with cardio-vascular disease.

Replacing the filters is critical for the effective reduction of particles in the air, and for healthier lungs. Following the manufacturer's recommendation for frequency is typically sufficient. People who have asthma or are highly sensitive may need to change filters more frequently.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Most pre-filters need replacement every 2-3 months. The HEPA filter can typically go one year, sometimes up to five years, depending on the size of the filter and how dusty the air is.

If you have asthma or are highly sensitive, you may need to change the filter more frequently. If you live in an area impacted by an acute outdoor pollution event (such as a wildfire) or chronic pollution (near a highway), you may need to change your filter more often. If you notice an odor coming from the air cleaner that is a signal that the filter definitely needs to be replaced.

Change filters according to manufacturer's instructions.

Are you changing the filter(s) in your ERV / HRV? Do you know they have one?

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-510

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Regularly change the air filters in your ERV / HRV per manufacturer's recommendation, with filters from the manufacturer. Local conditions and seasonal needs may require more frequent changes.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Failure to change the filter allows excess particles to get released from the filter and flow back into the home degrading indoor air quality.  Clogged filters also reduce airflow and efficiency of the unit and can damage the motor.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Locate the filter or filters as there may be more than one. Some units will have both an air IN filter and air OUT filter. Typically the filters can be at the ERV / HRV unit, they can also be located at the air intake at the outside of the home. Do not run the ERV / HRV unit without a filter and make sure the filter(s) are from the manufacturer.  Change regularly according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

If you live in an area impacted by an acute outdoor pollution event (such as wildfires), chronic pollution (such as near a highway), or have asthma/allergies/sensitivity, you may need to change your filters more frequently.

Determine the age of your carpet and should you replace it with…

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-550

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

The age of your carpet is important for determining the type of cleaning, or if replacement is needed.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Carpet acts like a reservoir collecting dirt, debris, dust and bacteria. Much of which is redistributed back in the air you breathe by walking on it. Vacuuming may appear to reduce the debris but can also significantly cause these contaminants to become airborne.  It is difficult to sufficiently clean a wall-to-wall carpet and as carpets age, no matter how well they've been cared for, contaminants will accumulate and the risk of health impacts will rise.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

The physical condition and the visual appearance can help determine the age of the carpet. If it is frayed, stained, shows signs of heavy traffic (wear) and/or has an odor, it is likely that it is more than 25 years old or hasn't been vacuumed/cleaned sufficiently over time. This would indicate the need for replacement and we recommend skipping carpet and opting for flooring with a non-porous, easily cleanable surface such as wood or tile.

Carpet in better condition (with no odors, staining, or excessive wear) may require frequent vacuuming to maintain it. Weekly vacuuming is the minimum recommended, but daily might be necessary. If there is insufficient progress with cleaning, then this would indicate the need for replacement with a non-porous, easily cleanable surface such as wood or tile.

If you have asthma or other respiratory issues, it is recommended that you replace carpet, regardless of age, with a non-porous, easily cleanable surface which is less likely to have health impacts.

Install a sealed barrier over the dirt floor of a crawlspace

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-650

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Your crawlspace has an exposed dirt floor and should be sealed by a professional.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Studies have shown that as much as 50% percent of the air which we breathe in the living space of a house can come from the crawlspace. Exposed dirt floors in a crawlspace can allow the growth of bacteria and mold and these contaminants can get into your home.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Your crawlspace needs to be sealed (encapsulated). Sealing a crawlspace can be complicated and we recommend a professional perform this installation. This installation can vary depending on your climate. The crawlspace should be fully evaluated for any structural damage or similar defects and the top of the crawlspace (floor to the house) should be air sealed. We recommend performing a radon test to determine if your home has elevated radon. Crawlspace encapsulation and a radon mitigation systems are very similar and best to be completed at the same time if needed.

Below are some general installation recommendations.
<ul>
 	<li>The plastic ground moisture barrier material thickness is typically 10-20 mil.  Thicker material is necessary to resist rips and tears.</li>
 	<li>The crawlspace dirt floor should be prepped by removing small rocks and debris.
<ul>
 	<li>Depending on the dirt floor some contractors will install dimpled plastic barrier below the plastic ground barrier</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>The plastic ground moisture barrier must be fully secured and sealed to the entire perimeter, all support posts, any other installations that are in the crawlspace floor, and all ground barrier seams must be fully sealed (typically below and at the visible seam).</li>
 	<li>Many areas have groundwater issues and a sump pump needs to be installed.</li>
 	<li>If you are in a potential flood area, you may need special flood foundation vents that allow water to escape if the crawlspace is flooded.</li>
</ul>
Some climates require a different installation of materials.
<ul>
 	<li>Option 1 (damp/humid climates):  Seal perimeter crawlspace foundation vents (openings) and add either add a system to control the moisture by mechanical ventilation and/or a dehumidifier. Insulate the crawlspace foundation walls in colder climates.</li>
 	<li>Option 2 (dry/moderate climates):  The perimeter crawlspace foundation vents (openings) are not sealed then the top of the crawlspace (floor to the house) must be fully air sealed and insulated.</li>
</ul>
There also may be differences because of past mold, water damage, or pest infestation. Talk to your contractor about which option is appropriate for your home.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Your crawlspace should be sealed by a professional because it has exposed dirt and is wet or occasionally wet. The source of the moisture should be identified and corrected.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Studies have shown that as much as 50% percent of the air which we breathe in the living space of a house can come from the crawlspace. Exposed dirt floors in a crawlspace, especially if they are continuously or occasionally wet, can allow the growth of bacteria and mold and these contaminants can get into your home.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

You have two conditions that are impacting each other that need to be evaluated corrected.

1) The drainage at the outside perimeter of the foundation should be evaluated and corrected as needed. It is important to prevent water from accumulating against your foundation, where it can soak below the surface where it can get into the crawlspace. We recommend walking the perimeter of the foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground) and make sure the site drainage is clearly visible from the house. Generally 6 feet out and 2 feet down.
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure roof drainage or gutter downspouts drain at least 3 feet from the foundation.</li>
 	<li>Have gutters installed, if you don't have them. If you have them, make sure they are cleaned prior to the rainy season starts.</li>
 	<li>Fill in low spots and be sure ground slopes away from the house. Keep plants away from the side of the house.</li>
 	<li>Move sprinklers so the water does not hit the exterior walls of the house.</li>
 	<li>Make sure landscaping does not trap moisture around the foundation.</li>
</ul>
2) Your crawlspace needs to be sealed. Sealing a crawlspace is a complicated installation and we recommend a professional perform this installation. This installation can vary depending on your climate. The crawlspace should be fully evaluated for any structural damage or similar defects and the top of the crawlspace (floor to the house) should be air sealed. We recommend performing a radon test to determine if your home has elevated radon.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

You or a professional should evaluate your crawlspace and confirm that the plastic ground barrier is completely sealed to the walls and around support posts. Confirm that mechanical ventilation fan(s) and/or a dehumidifier are working and that the dehumidifier has a proper moisture/water drain.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

The dirt floor in a crawlspace is commonly damp and allows the growth of bacteria and mold. This is why you want to make sure the plastic ground barrier is fully sealed and any moisture removing systems that are installed are working as intended. If the plastic ground barrier has openings or any mechanical system is not operating it compromises the entire installation. Studies have shown that as much as 50% percent of the air which we breathe in the living space of a house can come from an unsealed crawlspace or compromised crawlspace.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

We recommend a professional fully evaluate the crawlspace ground barrier and any mechanical moisture removing systems. If you evaluate the crawlspace we recommend you wear a basic respirator mask (N-95 or better) plus gloves and kneepads.

These are the conditions the professional or you are looking for:
<ul>
 	<li>Is the plastic ground barrier fully sealed to the entire perimeter, all support posts, any other installations, all ground barrier seams sealed, and there are no rips or tears?</li>
 	<li>Are there ventilation vents (openings) at the foundation perimeter walls?</li>
 	<li>If there are no vents in the foundation walls, is there a ventilation fan(s), do you know if they are operational (typically activated by a humidity level in the crawlspace)?</li>
 	<li>Does the access hatch have weatherstripping at the opening and does the door make a tight seal?</li>
 	<li>Is there a dehumidification unit (removes moisture / humidity) from the crawlspace. Make sure the small condensation (moisture) pump is going to the exterior.</li>
</ul>
Because of all of these complex options we recommend a professional evaluate and make recommendations. Even if the crawlspace appears to be clean and sealed the mechanical installations (ventilation fan(s) / dehumidifier) should be evaluated every year or every other year. Regular inspections prevent large repairs and keep crawlspace conditions from getting into your home.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Studies have shown that as much as 50% percent of the air which we breathe in the living space of a house can come from the crawlspace so the condition of your crawlspace matters a lot to your indoor air quality. Dirt floors and wet/damp conditions can allow for the growth of bacterial and mold. Just placing plastic sheeting on the ground isn't sufficient, crawlspaces should be tightly sealed.  If you don't know the condition of your crawlspace, you can't address any issues it may be causing in your home.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

The general evaluation of the crawlspace can be performed at the access hatch with a flashlight, we recommend you wear a basic respirator mask (N-95 or better).

These are the conditions a professional or you are looking for:
<ul>
 	<li>Is the dirt floor exposed or is it covered completely and tightly with a plastic ground barrier?</li>
 	<li>If the floor is exposed dirt, is it dry or wet (wet typically looks darker)?</li>
 	<li>If there is a plastic ground barrier covering the dirt
<ul>
 	<li>how thick is the plastic barrier?</li>
 	<li>is it continuous and sealed to the perimeter and any support posts?</li>
 	<li>or just laying on the ground not sealed to anything?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Are there ventilation vents (openings) at the foundation perimeter walls?</li>
 	<li>If there are no vents in the foundation walls, is there a ventilation fan(s), do you know if they are operational (typically activated by a humidity level in the crawlspace)?</li>
 	<li>Does the access hatch have weatherstripping at the opening and does the door make a tight seal?</li>
 	<li>Is there a dehumidification unit (removes moisture/humidity) from the crawlspace. Make sure the small condensation (moisture) pump is going to the exterior.</li>
</ul>
If your crawlspace has an exposed or partially exposed dirt floor and/or lacks a completely sealed barrier, ventilation vents, weather stripping,  and/or dehumidification, you could be impacting the air quality in your living spaces.

Because of all of these complex options and limited access to the crawlspace we recommend a professional evaluate and make recommendations. Even if the crawlspace appears to be clean and sealed the mechanical installations (ventilation fan(s) / dehumidifier) should be evaluated every year or every other year.  Regular inspections prevent large repairs and keep crawlspace contaminants from getting into your home.

Address issues causing seasonal dampness in your finished basement to reduce risk of hidden damage or mold growth behind finished surfaces or to fix problems that have already occurred.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Moisture is more common in finished basements than above ground areas of the house.  It may go unnoticed for long periods of time because it is hidden behind the finished surfaces of walls, ceilings, and floors.  This damp environment increases risk for structural damage plus the growth of bacteria and mold, the latter of which can impact health especially for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Check your finished basement for a musty or other off-odor which is a strong indicator that further evaluation for moisture or mold growth is needed.  Water stains, areas of softness or discoloration are other visual cues to look for.  If you notice any signs of mold or other growth, take steps to address quickly as more dampness will only make the problem worse.

Moisture in the basement can also start outside the house, penetrating through cracks in the foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground), around windows, or seeping up from below. Walk the perimeter of the foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground) and look for low spots against the foundation where rainwater and snow melt can accumulate while slowly draining deeper beneath the surface. Water pooling can also occur from downspouts too close to the foundation and water from sprinkler heads hitting the side of the house.  If you notice evidence of any of these conditions, you or a professional should address them to:
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure roof drainage or gutter downspouts drain at least 3 feet from the foundation.</li>
 	<li>Fill in low spots and be sure ground slopes away from the house. Keep plants away from the side of the house.</li>
 	<li>Move sprinklers so the water does not hit the exterior walls of the house.</li>

 	<li>Make sure roof drainage or gutter downspouts drain at least 3 feet from the foundation.</li>
 	<li>Fill in low spots and be sure ground slopes away from the house. Keep plants away from the side of the house.</li>
 	<li>Move sprinklers so the water does not hit the exterior walls of the house.</li>
 	<li>Make sure roof drainage and or gutter downspouts are also draining from the foundation and sprinklers do not spray water toward the house.</li>
</ul>

Walking the perimeter of your house can prevent structural issue & mold growth.

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

It is important to know about the structure and conditions of the slab-on-grade of your house. It is the floor of your house that is a concrete slab directly on the ground, rather than over a basement or a crawlspace. It is subject to cracking with age and to excess moisture beneath it slowly migrating to the top surface inside the house.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Concrete floors directly on the ground, rather than over a basement or crawlspace, are subject to moisture beneath it slowly migrating to the top surface where the dampness can warp wood flooring, grow mold under sheet flooring, or create damp spots in carpeting. All of which can result in the growth of bacteria and mold in the short term, plus physical damage over the longer term. Because moisture beneath flooring can be difficult to detect and because access below it is not possible,  maintenance is difficult to impossible. The potential for long term health effects and subsequent physical damage increases, especially after 20-25 years or so.

Annual monitoring of specific conditions is important to identify and stop moisture issues before minor repairs become major repairs, or eventually become catastrophic.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Begin the evaluation of the slab-on-grade floor of your house with a careful observation of the flooring itself.
<ul>
 	<li>Wood flooring will be warped, buckled, or discolored in damp spots where moisture below has migrated to the top - through weak spots, seams, or cracks.</li>
 	<li>Carpeting will have dark spots at wet spots, sometimes with discoloration. Damp spots won't be as visible but can often be detected by walking the entire surface while wearing socks. The socks will get damp from the wet spots and your feet will feel cool and damp.</li>
 	<li>Sheet flooring is harder to detect but may have some minor bubbling if the moisture intrusion is significant. Lifting a corner may reveal a damp or "musty" odor.</li>
 	<li>The floor of a laundry room or where the forced air system is located is often unfinished. Visual observation is sufficient to detect cracks in the floor. If moisture is wicking up from below there will usually be a whitish fringe along the cracks.</li>
</ul>
If any of the above are present, proceed to the inspection of the exterior of your house.

Moisture issues often start on the exterior of your home. It is important to prevent water from accumulating against your foundation, where it can soak below the surface where it can migrate beneath the slab and wick up through weak spots, seams, or small cracks. We recommend walking the perimeter of the foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground) and make sure the ground slopes away from the house at least 6 feet out with a 2 foot drop.
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure roof drainage or gutter downspouts drain at least 3 feet from the foundation.</li>
 	<li>Have gutters installed, if you don't have them. If you have them, make sure they are cleaned prior to the rainy season starts.</li>
 	<li>Fill in low spots and be sure ground slopes away from the house. Keep plants away from the side of the house.</li>
 	<li>Move sprinklers so the water does not hit the exterior walls of the house.</li>
 	<li>Make sure landscaping does not trap moisture around the foundation.</li>
</ul>
If any of the interior or exterior conditions above are identified, or if you are uncertain, you will need a professional assessment of the condition of the slab that includes a detailed report on what to do about it.

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Forced air systems located inside the house or in the attic need routine maintenance.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Periodic maintenance, including duct cleaning, and regular filter changes are recommended to keep the equipment in good working order and to ensure good indoor air quality.  If equipment doesn't work properly or if filter(s) are clogged, your system won't be able to sufficiently reduce dust and fine particulate in the air, impacting indoor air quality, and possibly health especially for those with ongoing respiratory issues such as asthma.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Locate the forced air system and, if needed, replace the current filter with a minimum of MERV 13 or equivalent according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Changing the filter every 2-3 months when the system is active - for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer - is typically sufficient. People who are sensitive or live near areas impacted (either acutely or chronically) by elevated levels of air pollution may find that filter(s) need to be changed more frequently.

If odor is present or if respiratory symptoms begin/increase when the blower turns on, we recommend hiring a professional to evaluate the system and located the source of the odor or "dust."

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Forced air systems located inside the garage are a direct air pathway for the pollutants in the garage circulating into the breathing zone of the living space.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Forced air systems located in the garage will actively pull the nearby air into the system and blow it throughout the entire house. Garage air typically contains dust, dampness, fumes of gasoline and oil, stored chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides, various fumes from cars and car engines.  None of which are healthy, all of which could severely affect those with asthma, allergies, COPD and other respiratory conditions. Those who are chemically intolerant could experience moderate to severe reactions.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Forced air systems located inside the garage have some special requirements in addition to routine maintenance. Do as many of the following as possible:
<ul>
 	<li>Store pesticides, fertilizers, gasoline, and other chemicals in a dry location outside of the house and garage. A detached storage shed is ideal. Download the Chemical Storage Action Plan for details.</li>
 	<li>Seal the enclosure for the forced air system - but include outside combustion make-up air - to keep the garage air from being sucked into the system and blown throughout the house.</li>
 	<li>Install an exhaust fan with a timer which is triggered by the opening and closing of the garage door to reduce the accumulation of car odors and pollutants.</li>

Forced air systems in will actively pull the air from the place they are located into the system and circulate it throughout the entire house. This means the air from your crawlspace or basement, and everything in it, is circulated throughout your living space.

Damp, unsealed crawlspaces and basements, especially those with dirt floors, are often filled with contaminants including dust, dirt, mold, bacteria, odors, and pest excrement. While exposure isn't healthy for anyone, it can be particularly impactful for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

In addition to the routine maintenance according to the manufacturer's recommendations for any forced air system, whether for heating or cooling, the following are important when the system is located in a space that is damp with a dirt floor:

Wall furnaces can be dangerous, we recommend having yours serviced. Also it

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

e-860

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Hire a professional, licensed HVAC contractor to assess, repair, or replace your wall furnace before next use. An improperly functioning wall furnace can produce dangerous, or even deadly, combustion gasses.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Wall furnaces can present specific dangers that other heat sources do not, especially during cold weather months (December, January, February).  Wall furnaces that do not exhaust combustion gasses outside will spew carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, moisture and other gasses into the room where you breathe them continuously. Even wall furnaces that do have an exhaust for combustion gasses can still allow some gasses to get into the room, where they can accumulate to unhealthy levels. The furnace uses the oxygen from the room for the flame in the unit. If the oxygen in the room is used up the unit can create and release carbon monoxide and other dangerous gasses.

Moderate levels of carbon monoxide are health damaging and may be experienced as strong headaches, dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, confusion, watery eyes, and breathing difficulties. Tell-tale symptoms of dangerous levels of exposure include flu-like symptoms, cherry-red lips, and an undeniable need to sleep. Vacate to the outdoors immediately as high level can lead to death in a matter of minutes.

More information on carbon monoxide can be found <a href="https://www.abe.iastate.edu/extension-and-outreach/carbon-monoxide-poisoning-health-effects-aen-166/">here.</a>

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

All wall furnace(s) should be fully evaluated before use by a licensed HVAC contractor. If they determine your unit does not sufficiently exhaust to the outside, ask the HVAC contractor to install make-up combustion air. If that cannot be done, then replace the unit with one that exhausts to the outdoors. Failure to do so increases the risk of illness or even death for the occupants.

In addition, we recommend installing a carbon monoxide detector that detects short term, low levels starting at 5 PPM with a visual alert activated when 10 PPM of CO is detected, and a visual and audible alarm that is activated at 15 PPM.

These precautionary levels compare to the U.S. Standards for CO levels:  Maximum of 35 ppm of CO for 1-hour exposure (not be exceeded more than once per year). Maximum of 9 ppm of CO for 8-hour exposure (not to be exceeded more than once per year).  See detailed chart of full range of exposure risk <a href="http://nyad.com/data/uploads/2017/04/carbon_monoxide_danger_levels.pdf">here</a>.

Find the location of your heating system

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-925

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Knowing the location of your forced air system is important for several reasons. If the location is not known then:
<ul>
 	<li>Filters cannot be changed.</li>
 	<li>Routine maintenance cannot be conducted .</li>
 	<li>Exposure from pollutants in crawlspaces, basements, garages, or attics cannot be identified and stopped.</li>
</ul>

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Not knowing the location of your forced air system likely means the filter hasn't been changed and may be clogged with dust supporting high levels of mold, bacteria, and other particles.

In addition, your forced air system will pull the air from the space where it is located and circulate it into your living space. This exposes occupants to a variety of contaminants which may impact health.  For example:
<ul>
 	<li>Crawlspaces and some basements often have damp, dirt floors which can lead to mold and other bacterial growth. This combines with other dust, dirt, and even pest excrement. Many of these are known allergens and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma, allergies, COPD,  or other respiratory conditions.</li>
 	<li>Garages can contain stored chemicals such as fertilizer, pesticides, gasoline, plus odors from the car, lawn mower or other items.</li>
 	<li>Attics are usually cleaner but are subject to intrusions by insects, birds, and small animals.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Find the location of your forced air system and at least make sure the filter is changed on a regular basis. We recommend using at least a MERV 11 filter (alternately FPR7-10 or MPR 1100-1500).  Changing filter(s) every 2-3 months is usually sufficient, but if you are sensitive to dust or other pollutants or in an area with heavy outdoor pollution, you may find you need to change filter(s) more frequently.

Once you know the location, we recommend hiring a licensed HVAC professional to make sure the system is in good working order and performing efficiently. Consider air sealing the location where the system is located so air isn't pulled into the blower and circulated into the breathing zone of the living space. Hire an professional duct cleaning company who complies with either the NADCA or ACCA Standard to inspect the ducting and clean if needed.

Identify the type of fuel source used for heat.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Knowing the type of fuel used in your home can be important for both safety and health. For example, fuel oil has a distinctive odor that permeates materials.  Odors are not something separate from the substance. The odor IS the substance. When you smell fuel oil you're breathing it. Exposure to fuel oil can be a chemical intolerance trigger for some and may exacerbate asthma and other respiratory symptoms.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

You may be able to identify the fuel source by checking bills you receive from energy companies or looking at meter/tank.

If the fuel source is fuel oil, if the odors are strong enough to notice, and especially if you have reactions, then increased ventilation can help. If it isn't sufficient and if the impact on your ability to function is sufficient, then you will likely need to either switch to a different type of heating or move.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

To minimize risks to health and safety, fireplaces or wood stoves used as your heat source should be inspected regularly to verify they are in good working order.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Fireplaces or wood burning stoves used as a heat source produce higher rates of pollutants for longer periods of time than when used only occasionally.

Wood burning fireplaces or stoves generate combustion products, chemicals from the fuel source, CO2 and CO, plus a broad range of particulate. All of which are respiratory irritants and potential asthma triggers.  Gas fireplaces or stoves also produce combustion products plus CO2 and potentially CO.

All types should have sealed combustion chambers with the make-up air coming from outdoors to minimize the risk of exposure to pollutants and maintain safe operation.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Wood fireplaces and stoves:
<ul>
 	<li>Verify they are rated for wood.</li>
 	<li>Verify the combustion air is from outside.</li>
 	<li>Verify the combustion chamber is sealed</li>
 	<li>Use only wood - not lumber or magazines. Both likely contain chemicals that will be released into the air.</li>
 	<li>Inspect wood stored outside for dampness, insects, or rodents.</li>
</ul>
Gas fireplaces and stoves:
<ul>
 	<li>Verify they are rated for gas.</li>
 	<li>Verify the combustion air is from outdoors.</li>
 	<li>Verify the combustion chamber is sealed.</li>
 	<li>Find the gas shutoff valve for the fireplace and for the house.</li>
 	<li>Immediately vacate the house if you smell gas - it will have a rotten egg type odor. Do not turn lights on or off as the spark can ignite an explosion. Call the fire department from outside the house.</li>
</ul>
If you are unable to do all of the steps yourself, hire a professional licensed contractor to confirm all operational conditions are being met.

In addition, we recommend installing a carbon monoxide detector that detects short term, low levels starting at 5 PPM with a visual alert activated when 10 PPM of CO is detected, and a visual and audible alarm that is activated at 15 PPM.

These precautionary levels compare to the U.S. Standards for CO levels:  Maximum of 35 ppm of CO for 1-hour exposure (not be exceeded more than once per year). Maximum of 9 ppm of CO for 8-hour exposure (not to be exceeded more than once per year).  See detailed chart of full range of exposure risk here.

Carefully maintain evaporative (swamp) coolers

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1030

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Your cooling system uses an evaporative cooler, also known as a swamp cooler, which requires careful maintenance.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Evaporative (swamp) coolers operate by blowing the hot outside air through a mat saturated with water. The water is heated by the air, which means the air is cooled. The cool air is then blown into the house. However, the cool air now is more humid which can raise the humidity inside the house sufficiently to increase the risk of growth of bacteria and mold on surfaces and contents.

In addition, swamp coolers require frequent and diligent maintenance to prevent bacterial and mold growth inside the cooler itself - which will then be blown throughout the house, adding to the risk of mold and bacteria growth elsewhere in the house.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Evaporative coolers should be meticulously cleaned and disinfected at the beginning and end of the cooling season, which will vary depending on your climate.  The evaporative pads should be replaced at least once a year. Some pads contain anti-microbial chemicals which may impact those who are chemically sensitive, so carefully assess what you purchase.  Finally, ensure that the ducting from the blower to the supply vents inside the house are (and stay) clean and dry.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Windows that cannot be opened can negatively impact indoor air quality and are a potential safety issue.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Without adequate ventilation carbon dioxide, odors, chemicals, and moisture will accumulate inside the house.  These conditions can increase the risk of mold and bacterial growth.  Depending on personal sensitivity, even small amounts of chemicals or mold can impact occupant health.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

If your window(s) are not operational we recommend these be evaluated and repaired or replaced by a professional if needed. Windows must be able to be opened, stay open and closed and lock. Windows that do not close can allow in unwanted contaminates, moisture and noise. Controlling your environment and being able to open a window when you want is fundamental for comfort and a healthy environment.

Windows are not just a source of ventilation but in bedrooms are a required fire egress. If in a bathroom that does not have an exhaust fan, these serve as the means to remove moisture.

Is your Radon mitigation system working correctly?

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

All installed radon mitigation systems should have a constant monitoring method, annual evaluation, and periodic re-testing.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Radon is a radioactive gas found all across the US. It moves up from the soil into your home through cracks and other openings in the foundation, slab, or basement floor, plus open dirt floors in crawlspaces and basements.  Radon accumulates inside the lower levels of the house and will migrate up into the breathing zone of the living space with normal air circulation. Forced air systems will distribute the radon throughout the house. As a gas, it will be in the air and you can be exposed continuously.  According to the EPA, the primary known health effect of long-term radon exposure is lung cancer.

Homes with radon mitigation systems need periodic confirmation of operation, because:
<ul>
 	<li>There is no safe level of exposure to radon.</li>
 	<li>All homes may have a radon problem - whether new or old, well-sealed or drafty, with or without basements or crawl spaces.</li>
</ul>

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

There are three parts to addressing and maintaining radon systems: Testing, Mitigation (if needed), and Monitoring.

<strong>How to Test</strong>

Radon testing can be performed by occupants. For most accurate results, use a 91 day (long-term) test, not the 2-10 day (short-term) test. Although radon is not regulated, the EPA official guidance for mitigation is 4 pCi/L (picocuries per liter). However, because there is no “safe level” of exposure, and because of the risk of lung cancer, Hayward Score recommends mitigation above 2 pCi/L. Contact the EPA and your State Department of Health for details on testing and for finding licensed mitigation contractors.

<strong>Mitigation</strong>

Mitigation procedures can vary depending on your foundation type, slab, basement, or crawl space and soil conditions.

Mitigation systems are designed to create a suction pressure with an exhaust fan to capture and remove the radon before it gets into your home. The system can be either a sub-slab depressurization system (below the concrete floor) or a crawl space depressurization system with a soil barrier that is sealed to the entire perimeter, structural supports, and heating and cooling equipment.

The fan is continuously operating and can be located in an unfinished attic or outside the house (the fan should not be installed in the crawl space or the basement). It must exhaust to the outside air no lower than the roof of the home. The pipes should be labeled “RADON SYSTEM” and should not be connected to any plumbing or drainage system.

<strong>Monitoring</strong>

There must be a visible indicator confirming the system is working correctly. The most common is a “U” shaped tube that shows that the colored water level is higher on one side than the other which confirms the fan is operating and removing air from below the crawl space or below the concrete slab.

The water “U” shaped gauge should be checked regularly. Electronic systems with alarms will notify you if the fan stopped running or if it is not depressurizing the system.

If you have not installed a continuous radon monitor, your radon mitigation system should be re-checked and confirmed every 2 years by measurement, that the levels are below 4 pCi/L at least, or preferably below 2 pCi/L. For all systems, the seal around the exhaust pipe and the soil barrier in the crawl space should be visibly evaluated annually.

The most common is a “U” shaped tube that shows that the colored water level is higher on one side than the other which confirms the fan is operating and removing air from below the crawl space or below the concrete slab.

The water “U” shaped gauge should be checked regularly. Electronic systems with alarms will notify you if the fan stopped running or if it is not depressurizing the system.

If you have not installed a continuous radon monitor, your radon mitigation system should be re-checked and confirmed every 2 years by measurement, that the levels are below 4 pCi/L at least, or preferably below 2 pCi/L. For all systems, the seal around the exhaust pipe and the soil barrier in the crawl space should be evaluated annually.

Your home is in EPA Radon Zone 1 (High). We recommend you have your home tested

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1245

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

All homes should be tested for radon, especially those in EPA Zone 1, the area of highest risk. Complete mitigation if needed.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Radon is a radioactive gas found all across the US. It moves up from the soil into your home through cracks and other openings in the foundation, slab, or basement floor, plus open dirt floors in crawlspaces and basements.  Radon accumulates inside the lower levels of the house and will migrate up into the breathing zone of the living space with normal air circulation. Forced air systems will distribute the radon throughout the house. As a gas, it will be in the air and air is everywhere. According to the EPA, the primary known health effect of long-term radon exposure is lung cancer.

All homes should be tested for radon, because:
<ul>
 	<li>There is no safe level of exposure to radon.</li>
 	<li>All homes may have a radon problem - whether new or old, well-sealed or drafty, with or without basements or crawl spaces.</li>
 	<li>The levels in your home, especially in Zone 1, are at high risk to be elevated, even if your neighbor's house is not.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

There are three parts to addressing radon: Testing, Mitigation (if needed), and Monitoring.

<strong>How to Test</strong>

Radon testing can be performed by occupants. For most accurate results, use a 91 day (long-term) test, not the 2-5 day (short-term) test. Although radon is not regulated, the EPA official guidance for mitigation is 4 pCi/L (picocuries per liter). However, because there is no “safe level” of exposure, and because of the risk of lung cancer, Hayward Score recommends mitigation above 2 pCi/L. Contact the EPA and your State Department of Health for details on testing and for finding licensed mitigation contractors.

<strong>How to Mitigate</strong>

Mitigation procedures can vary depending on your foundation type, slab, basement, or crawl space and soil conditions.

Mitigation systems are designed to create a suction pressure with an exhaust fan to capture and remove the radon before it gets into your home. The system can be either a sub-slab depressurization system (below the concrete floor) or a crawl space depressurization system with a soil barrier that is sealed to the entire perimeter, structural supports, and heating and cooling equipment.

The fan is continuously operating and can be located in the attic or outside the house (the fan should not be installed in the crawl space or the basement). It must exhaust to the outside air no lower than the roof of the home. The pipes should be labeled “RADON SYSTEM” and should not be connected to any plumbing or drainage system.

<strong>Monitoring</strong>

There must be a visible indicator confirming the system is working correctly. The most common is a “U” shaped tube that shows that the colored water level is higher on one side than the other which confirms the fan is operating and removing air from below the crawl space or below the concrete slab.

The water “U” shaped gauge should be checked regularly. Electronic systems with alarms will notify you if the fan stopped running or if it is not depressurizing the system.

If you have not installed a continuous radon monitor, your radon mitigation system should be re-checked and confirmed every 2 years by measurement, that the levels are below 4 pCi/L at least, or preferably below 2 pCi/L. For all systems, the seal around the exhaust pipe and the soil barrier in the crawl space should be evaluated annually.

Living within a half mile of a farm or agricultural area,

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1260

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Minimize indoor exposure to outdoor pollutants like dust, chemicals, odors, and pollen from nearby agricultural areas which can travel in the air for as much as a half mile or more and migrate inside your house.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Farms and agricultural areas can be a source for a number of contaminants. Dust can be from windblown soil, pollen from the plants, and from the dried crops during or after harvest. Chemicals can include combustion exhaust from farm equipment, fuel fumes, grease and other lubricants on the equipment, and from application of pesticides and fertilizers. Livestock can also produce chemicals including odors from the animals, the feed, chemicals treatments, and especially manure. Odors from cattle feedlots, chicken breeding, and hog production can be quite troublesome.

These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows. They can also infiltrate through smaller, hidden, air pathways like around window frames, edges of the outside cladding, down chimneys, and especially through basements and crawlspaces. While forces such as wind and temperature differences can force the contaminants inside there are no equivalent forces to move them back outside. The result is a potential accumulation that has been measured as much as 10 times the outside levels.

While the risk of exposure is more acute for those who work on the farms, long-term or constant exposure inside your home can become both a physiological  and psychological irritant. A few may even have their asthma, chemical intolerance, respiratory conditions, or other symptoms triggered by the exposure to farms or agricultural areas.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Survey the 1/2 mile or so around your house to identify all farms and agricultural areas. Note whether they are generally downwind or upwind from the house. If the prevailing wind directions is away from your house you may not need to take any action. However, if the prevailing wind is from the sources toward your house, then successful remedies may become more difficult and complex.

Required openings such as windows, combustion or exhaust vents, and other venting must remain open. But the smaller air pathways can often be identified by visual observation and sealed with low-toxic materials. Walk around the house with an eye to cracked or shrunken caulking around windows and door frames. Replace the caulking with zero-VOC water-based caulks. Note any damaged siding or roof shingles and repair or replace as needed.

Regardless of the outdoor pollutant source, or how close or far away the source is from the house, there are only a few choices if you are significantly impacted:

1) Make the house more airtight to prevent infiltration of the outside sources. Proper air sealing requires a professional.

Minimize indoor exposure to outdoor pollutants including jet fuel combustion products and other chemicals from a nearby airport which can travel in the air for as much as a half mile or more, and migrate inside your house.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Airports can be a significant source of jet fuel combustion from frequent landings and takeoffs. Because of the altitude changes from ground level to thousands of feet and the force of the engine exhaust the contaminants can travel long distances.

These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows. They can also infiltrate through smaller, hidden, air pathways like around window frames, edges of the outside cladding, down chimneys, and especially through basements and crawlspaces. While forces such as wind and temperature differences can force the contaminants inside there are no equivalent forces to move them back outside.

Minimize indoor exposure to outdoor pollutants to combustion products and other chemicals from high traffic streets and highways which can travel in the air for as much as a half mile or more and migrate inside your house.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Traffic on highways and busy city streets produce a variety of contaminants. The most obvious is the exhaust from the engines of cars and trucks. The more troublesome is from diesel engines from heavy trucks and buses. Less obvious, but still of significant concern is the particles that get into the air from the abrasion of brake pads and of the street wearing down tires.

These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows.

Minimize indoor exposure to gasses, fumes, smoke, and other harsh pollutants or hazards from industrial areas or chemical plants which can travel in the air for as much as a half mile or more, or migrate in groundwater, and accumulate inside your house.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Industrial and chemical plants within 1/2 mile of your home can be an especially troublesome source of exposure to outdoor pollutants. The high levels of traffic from employees coming and going creates a significant source of combustion gasses plus particles from tire and brake pad wear. The exhaust and other outputs from the industrial or chemical plant can contain more than the uncomfortable or irritating levels of irritants and odors. Depending on the substances used in the plant and the efficacy of pollution controls (if any), emissions of a wide variety of contaminants, hazards, and potential poisons are possible.

These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows. They can also infiltrate through smaller, hidden, air pathways like around window frames, edges of the outside cladding, down chimneys, and especially through basements and crawlspaces. While forces such as wind and temperature differences can force the contaminants inside there are no equivalent forces to move them back outside. The result is a potential accumulation that has been measured as much as 10 times the outside levels. Pollution of drinking water is a frequent and known hazard near may industrial and chemical plants.

While the risk of exposure is more acute for those who work at these locations, long-term or constant exposure inside your home can become a hazard. Even at lower levels of exposure they can be  both a physiological  and psychological irritant. A few may even have their asthma, chemical intolerance, respiratory conditions, or other symptoms triggered by the exposure to airports.

Although most people find the aroma of coffee very pleasant and stimulating, long-term or constant exposure can become both a psychological and a physiological irritant. A few may even have their asthma, chemical intolerance, respiratory conditions, or other symptoms triggered by the aroma.

Coffee roasting produces chemicals including diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione with known respiratory health risks.  These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows. They can also infiltrate through smaller, hidden, air pathways like around window frames, edges of the outside cladding, down chimneys, and especially through basements and crawlspaces. While forces such as wind and temperature differences can force the contaminants inside there are no equivalent forces to move them back outside. The result is a potential accumulation that has been measured as much as 10 times the outside levels.

Control indoor exposure to outdoor pollutants from nearby wood smoke

You live 1 block from neighbors’ wood smoke

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1315

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Minimize indoor exposure to fine particulate matter or PM2.5 and chemicals including benzene and formaldehyde from wood smoke which can travel in the air for as much as a half mile or more and migrate inside your house.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Although many people find the aroma of wood smoke pleasant and sometimes romantic, exposure isn't healthy for anyone.

The biggest health threat from smoke is from fine particulate matter or PM2.5. These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system, where they may cause burning eyes, runny nose, and respiratory conditions such as bronchitis. Fine particles can make asthma symptoms worse and trigger asthma attacks. They have also been associated with cardiovascular disease, stroke, irregular heart rhythms, and potential heart failure, especially in people who are already at risk for these conditions. Wood smoke from your neighbors' fireplace or wood burning stove can also contain several toxic air pollutants including benzene, formaldehyde, acrolein, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows. They can also infiltrate through smaller, hidden, air pathways like around window frames, edges of the outside cladding, down chimneys, and especially through basements and crawlspaces. While forces such as wind and temperature differences can force the contaminants inside there are no equivalent forces to move them back outside. The result is a potential accumulation that has been measured as much as 10 times the outside levels.

Although wood burning is banned in many places, there are still locations where it is permitted. The exhaust can linger in the air and travel up to a block or more. In some low-lying areas, it can accumulate over longer distances.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Survey around your house for at least one block to identify all locations of neighbors wood smoke. Note whether they are generally downwind or upwind from the house. If the prevailing wind direction is from the sources toward your house, then successful remedies may become more difficult and complex.

Regardless of the outdoor pollutant source, or how close or far away the source is from the house, there are only a few choices if you are significantly impacted:

1) Make the house more airtight to prevent infiltration of the outside sources. Proper air sealing requires a professional.

Minimize indoor exposure to the "fresh" and sometimes "musty" odors from lakes and wetlands which can travel in the air for as much as a block or more and migrate inside your house.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

While living near a body of water like a lake, river, or wetland, can be desirable, it is important to be aware of potential risks.  While they are a necessary part of nature, constantly damp soil can produce significant overgrowth of bacteria, mold, and rotting vegetation. Although most people find lakes and wetlands very pleasant and stimulating, long-term or constant exposure can become both a physiological and a psychological irritant. A few may even have their asthma, chemical intolerance, respiratory conditions, or other symptoms triggered.

These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows. They can also infiltrate through smaller, hidden, air pathways like around window frames, edges of the outside cladding, down chimneys, and especially through basements and crawlspaces.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Minimize indoor exposure to occasional outdoor pollutants from nearby ocean under certain storm conditions or other water events which can travel in the air as much as a block or more and migrate inside your house.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Oceans are beautiful and often desirable locations for homes as they are perceived as "health promoting" locations. However, some vegetation near the shore can stay damp and produce overgrowth of bacteria and mold.

Of particular concern, increasingly as the climate changes and warms, is the proliferation of red tide, brown tide, and cyanobacterial growth. These not only smell unpleasant but are strong respiratory and eye irritants and can lead to health problems in otherwise healthy individuals. A few may even have their asthma, chemical intolerance, respiratory conditions, or other symptoms triggered by these events long before the general population becomes aware.

These and other contaminants outside the house will come inside through obvious openings such as vents and open windows. They can also infiltrate through smaller, hidden, air pathways like around window frames, edges of the outside cladding, down chimneys, and especially through basements and crawlspaces. While forces such as wind and temperature differences can force the contaminants inside there are no equivalent forces to move them back outside.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Running the kitchen exhaust hood during cooking, and for a few minutes after, is necessary to remove gas combustion products and moisture from boiling and steaming.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Cooking, including when boiling or steaming, produces high amounts of gas combustion products and moisture. The moisture in the kitchen can flow through the house and combine with other moisture sources such as showers without running the bath fan(s) and from people and pets living in the home can allow mold and bacterial growth. Areas that have high moisture conditions can cause a variety of health symptoms and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma, allergies, COPD, and other respiratory conditions.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Running the kitchen exhaust hood while cooking is important to remove gas combustion products plus moisture, especially when boiling or steaming food. If your range hood is not large enough to cover the front burners, cook on the back burners. Make sure the fan is working properly and is vented to the outside (not recirculating).  If you don't have an exhaust fan in your kitchen have one installed so it vents to the outside.  If installing a fan is not an option (and outdoor air quality is ok) open a window to vent some moisture.

Running the kitchen exhaust hood during cooking, and for a few minutes after, is necessary to remove moisture, especially from boiling and steaming.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Cooking is pleasant and nutritious, so what could possibly be harmful? It is precisely this belief that has kept the potential risks of cooking from being properly investigated.

Cooking, even without a gas stove, creates and releases a vast combination of particulate, gasses, odors, and moisture. Each of which can be a trigger for a susceptible individual.    Pollutants that are not exhausted to the outdoors can also accumulate on surfaces and contents, which lengthens the time when you might be exposed. While most people do not react negatively to these exposures, those with respiratory conditions, asthma, or chemical intolerance, can experience a significant impact.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Always run the exhaust fan while cooking. If your range hood is not large enough to cover the front burners, cook on the back burners. Make sure the fan is working properly and is vented to the outside (not recirculating).

If you don't have an exhaust fan in your kitchen or you have a recirculating fan and the impact of cooking is significant for you, have a new fan installed.  Make sure it vents outside and is large enough to cover both the front and back burners. This requires the installation of ducting and it is advisable to use a contractor.

If installing a fan is not an option (and outdoor air quality is ok) open a window to vent some of the moisture, particulates, and chemicals.

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Cooking is pleasant and nutritious, so what could possibly be harmful? It is precisely this belief that has kept the potential risks of cooking from being properly investigated.

Cooking, especially with gas stoves, creates and releases a vast combination of particulate, gasses, odors, and moisture. Each of which can be a trigger for a susceptible individual.    Gas stoves release combustion byproducts, including carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, that need to be exhausted so they don't pollute the indoor air or create unsafe conditions in your home.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Always run your bathroom exhaust fan while showering and for 20 minutes afterward to minimize excess moisture and condensation on surfaces such as ceilings and walls which, over time, can lead to mold growth and structural damage.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Moisture and condensation on walls, ceilings, and other surfaces can allow mold and bacterial growth and lead to long-term structural damage. Areas that have high moisture conditions can cause a variety of health symptoms and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions.

Even if you don't notice any signs now, always remembering to run the fan, can help to prevent issues from developing in the future.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Always run the bath exhaust fan during showering and for an additional 20 minutes afterward. You may want to install an inexpensive timer switch which will automatically shut off the exhaust fan after a pre-set amount of time.

If you notice condensation, check that the fan is running and is actually moving air and moisture from the room to the outside. Just being able to hear the fan isn't enough. An easy way to check is to place a single piece of toilet tissue against the vent when the fan is running. If the tissue "sticks," it is a good indication that the fan is working properly.

It is also important to make sure that the exhaust fan is vented outdoors. The fan should vent directly to the exterior. The best way to check this is to turn all the bathroom and laundry room fan on and see if the air is exhausting to the exterior, a damper will open confirming air is blowing to the exterior. Exhaust fans should have a damper to prevent air from flowing back into the house and prevents birds from nesting in the opening. Some exhaust fans vent to the roof or other areas that are not accessible.

If you don't have a bathroom exhaust fan, we strongly recommend installing one that has a timer or continuous low flow exhaust. If a fan isn't an option, open a window for ventilation.

Run exhaust fans to prevent high humidity and condensation on surfaces when using steam showers or spa tubs to reduce risk of mold.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Steam shower and or spa tubs can create large amounts of moisture and cause frequent condensation on walls, ceilings, and other surfaces. This condensed moisture, combined with dust creates a condition which can support mold and bacterial growth - and eventually even physical damage if allowed to continue.

High moisture and the growth of mold and bacteria, even when not visible, can lead to a variety of health symptoms and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), there is sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure of damp indoor environments to upper respiratory symptoms and asthma symptoms in sensitized people.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Run the bath exhaust fan during showering and for an additional 20 minutes afterward. This is especially important if you use a steam nozzle, indoor jacuzzi, or spa tub. You may want to install an inexpensive timer switch which will automatically shut off the exhaust fan after a pre-set amount of time. Or, a switch with a humidity sensor to keep the fan running until a less risky level of humidity is reached.

If you're operating the fan but still notice condensation, check that the fan is actually removing air from the room. Just being able to hear the fan isn't enough. An easy way to check is to place a single piece of toilet tissue against the vent when the fan is running. If the tissue "sticks," it is a good indication that the fan is removing air.

It is also important to make sure that the exhaust fan is vented directly outdoors, and not into the crawlspace or attic. The best way to check this is to turn all the bathroom fans on, go outside, and find the exhaust vents. If you can't find them outside, check the attic and crawlspace. If you can find them outside, a flap (called a damper) will push open as the air blows through it. You should also be able to feel the air blowing out with your hand if accessible. Some exhaust fans vent to the roof or other outside areas and are not accessible. Exhaust fans should have a damper to prevent air from flowing back into the house and prevents birds from nesting in the opening.

If you don't have an exhaust fan, we strongly recommend installing one. If a fan isn't an option, open a window for ventilation.

This condensed moisture, combined with dust creates a condition which can support mold and bacterial growth - and eventually even physical damage if allowed to continue.

High moisture and the growth of mold and bacteria, even when not visible, can lead to a variety of health symptoms and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), there is sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure of damp indoor environments to upper respiratory symptoms and asthma symptoms in sensitized people.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Evaluating the condition may be easy (depending if you need to access the attic) but upgrading the fan, if needed, is a more challenging repair and may require a professional handyman or contractor.

Condensation on wall or ceilings in the bathroom(s), despite turning on the exhaust fan, is an indication of at least one or several reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>The fan is not running long enough</li>
 	<li>The fan isn't working properly</li>
 	<li>The fan is not sized correctly for the room and the amount of humidity</li>
 	<li>The showers are long and very hot.</li>
 	<li>There is a cold surface where the condensation occurs</li>
</ul>
Running the fan during, and for 20 minutes after, showering should be sufficient, if not, try running the fan at least 40 minutes. For convenience, you may want to install an inexpensive timer switch which will automatically shut off the exhaust fan after a pre-set amount of time. Or, install a humidity controlled fan switch so the fan runs until the humidity is sufficiently reduced.

If you're operating the fan but still notice condensation, check that the fan is actually removing air from the room. Just being able to hear the fan isn't enough. An easy way to check is to place a single piece of toilet tissue against the vent when the fan is running. If the tissue "sticks," it is a good indication that the fan is removing air.

It is also important to make sure that the exhaust fan is vented directly outdoors, and not into the crawlspace or attic. The best way to check this is to turn all the bathroom fans on, go outside, and find the exhaust vents. If you can't find them outside, check the attic and crawlspace. If you can find them outside, a flap (called a damper) will push open as the air blows through it. You should also be able to feel the air blowing out with your hand if accessible. Some exhaust fans vent to the roof or other outside areas and are not accessible. Exhaust fans should have a damper to prevent air from flowing back into the house and prevents birds from nesting in the opening.

One other condition to evaluate is moisture condensates on surfaces that are cold enough for the vapor to change to a liquid. If you have condensation on only some surfaces the wall or ceiling may be cold enough to allow condensation. The wall or ceiling may have missing insulation or air leakage that causes the wall to get cold. If the fan is running properly, then check for other large moisture sources in the vicinity such as frequent cooking in an adjacent kitchen. Make sure those areas have their own sufficient ventilation, especially while moisture generating activities are occurring.

If the fan is exhausting air but condensation still occurs, you may need to replace the fan with one that exhausts more air, Cubic Feet Per Minute (CFM). Most bathroom fans are 50-70 CFM, larger bathrooms or high moisture area can require 125-150 CFM.

Check that your humidifier isn't adding too much moisture to the air

Using a room humidifier

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1515

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Humidifiers can easily generate too much humidity. An inexpensive humidity meter ($10-$30) will help you keep the Relative Humidity (RH) in the room between 30% and 60%.  RH consistently above about 70% can lead to conditions where mold can grow. It's also important to periodically clean the humidifier to prevent growth of bacteria and mold.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Relative Humidity (RH) consistently below about 30% can be uncomfortable and lead to drier mucous membranes - which become irritated and can lead to an increase in upper respiratory infections. Humidifiers can effectively increase the RH to more comfortable and healthier levels.

However, humidifiers can also create new problems.
<ul>
 	<li> They must be monitored to prevent excess humidity near cold surfaces, or for sustained periods of time of 2-3 weeks in hot, dry weather.</li>
 	<li>Frequent and regular cleaning is essential to prevent amplification of bacteria and mold. "Humidifier fever" is a well documented illness.</li>
 	<li>Ultrasonic humidifiers produce a fine white powder from the minerals in tap water. They must use distilled water only.</li>
 	<li>Humidifiers installed in the central heating system can easily contaminate an entire house if they malfunction or are not monitored. They should use a flow-through grid rather than using a moist pad or a reservoir of standing water for the source of moisture.</li>
</ul>
According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), there is sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure of damp indoor environments to upper respiratory symptoms and asthma symptoms in sensitized people. Moist air can be a relief for some people but can be a respiratory issue for others.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Consider purchasing an inexpensive relative humidity (RH) meter ($10-30). Monitor the RH of the room to ensure that it doesn't go above 65% for more than a few hours.  Keep your humidifier free of mold and bacteria by cleaning regularly per manufacturer's instructions. Clean up leaks and spills from your humidifier as soon as you notice them.

If your humidifier is connected to your heating and cooling system (HVAC), it should be serviced annually to twice a year. Use only the flow-through units, not the ones with damp pads or water reservoirs. Make sure the units are cleaned and serviced regularly to minimize the risk of mold and bacteria growth inside the unit.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Evaluate and correct any areas where water pools against your foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground) either from rain, snowmelt, or downspout drainage or hits the exterior of your house from sprinklers) to reduce risk of mold and structural damage.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Poor drainage at the perimeter of your house and foundation can lead to expensive structural issues and be a direct source of moisture into your home. Moisture below the foundation or crawlspace evaporates upward and into the house where it can cause excessive moisture inside the house with the potential for causing mold and bacterial growth. Areas that have high moisture conditions can cause a variety of health symptoms and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Moisture issues often start on the exterior of your home. It is important to prevent water from accumulating against your foundation, where it can soak below the surface where it can migrate through small cracks in the foundation.

We recommend walking the perimeter of the house and look for signs of standing water near the house or landscaping that is close to or touching the house. Good drainage around the house should clearly slope away from the house. If the ground is flat or slopes back to the house water will drain back to the foundation. Generally, acceptable drainage is 6 feet out from the house and slopes 2 feet down.
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure roof drainage or gutter downspouts drain at least 3 feet from the foundation.</li>
 	<li>Have gutters installed, if you don't have them. If you have them, make sure they are cleaned prior to the rainy season starts.</li>

Water flowing down the sides of the house and accumulating against the foundation (where the exterior walls meet the ground) can penetrate inside and lead to expansive structural issues. It can also be a direct source of moisture into your home, resulting in mold and bacterial growth.  Areas that have high moisture conditions can cause a variety of health symptoms and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions.

We recommend installing gutters that are large enough to handle the ran for your area. Many homes have gutters that are too small to accommodate the rain which then overflows and causes damage. Make sure the gutter downspouts discharge the water at least 3 feet from the foundation and the water easily drains from the foundation. Gutters require regular cleaning to prevent becoming clogged.

If you can not install gutters make sure the drainage from the roof is not gathering at the foundation near the house.  It is important to prevent water from accumulating against your foundation, where it can soak below the surface where it can migrate through small cracks in the foundation.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Unpleasant or "musty" odors is one of the best indications that something is wrong.  Instead of hiding the smell with an air freshener or scented candle, find the source of the odor and address the underlying problem.

The most reliable indicator of dampness and potential mold growth, is "musty" odors.  Determining if you have "mold" can be a difficult and disconcerting situation to be in. Because there is no definitive test for "mold," careful observation during an open-ended exploration can help to determine whether or not there is "mold." Or, if there are other exposure challenges in your house instead.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

A "musty" odor is one of the most reliable clues that your home has a moisture and/or mold problem.

Yet, there are many misconceptions about mold, such as what it looks like and how it can affect people (or not). Common beliefs can incorrectly conclude the presence of mold growth when there is none. Other common beliefs can incorrectly conclude that mold cannot cause the complaints and health issues that occupants report. It is as important to know if you don't have "mold" as it is to know if you do, so that you don't waste time and money solving the "wrong" problem.

If there is "mold" then it's important to understand that exposure has been linked to a wide variety of health complaints in otherwise healthy people. Low level exposure can be particularly problematic for people who already have asthma, allergies, COPD, or other respiratory conditions. Non-respiratory complaints are also commonly reported by those living in damp houses.

Mold and moisture that has not been promptly and properly remediated can eventually lead to worsening health issues, plus damage to both the building structure and its contents. Continued neglect can further increase symptoms plus populations of bacteria, insects, and rodents. Water-damaged materials can release a wide variety of chemicals, particularly problematic for those with chemical intolerance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Determining what is causing an odor can be challenging. For example, if you can't easily locate where the odor is coming from, open doors and windows for several minutes to clear the odor out of the house. Close the house back up and then walk around the house until you can detect the odor. It may take time to notice the odor again.  The source of the problem is most likely a location close to where you notice the odor.

<strong>Common Odors</strong>
Odors from pet urine can be easy to locate but particularly difficult to remove. Some enzymes can be helpful but be aware that the usual fragrance and other chemicals may be an issue. Sewer-like odors are often from the traps in drains that have not been used for a month or more. The water in trap evaporates, allowing sewer odors to migrate from the sewer line into the house.

<strong>General Mold Procedures and Initial Information</strong>
Mold can grow only where there has been sufficient dampness long enough for the spores to germinate and grow. If you find the damp spots (or even the dried spots), you will also find any mold growth which may be present. The first step for determining if you have a mold problem is to explore, looking for the following clues:
<ul>
 	<li>Have there been any leaks, flooding, or condensation in the house?</li>
 	<li>Are there any unexplained damp spots on walls or ceilings?</li>
 	<li>Are there water stains on walls or ceilings?</li>
 	<li>Are there discolorations that partially wipe off, or smear, on the surface?</li>
 	<li>Are there musty or other "off" odors?</li>
</ul>
If you answer "no" to all of the above questions, then it is unlikely that you have "mold." If you answer "yes" to one or more, then the investigation which follow will be helpful.

<strong>Mold Testing</strong>
Although testing for mold is popular and the results can sometimes be helpful, the results can easily create more confusion than clarity.

Where should you collect the samples for lab analysis? Locating the damp spots (and other characteristics above) will identify the location for collecting the samples.

Which of the many sample types is best? There are more than a dozen combinations of samples types and lab analysis methods, each revealing a different part of the situation.

Because testing itself is not definitive, select carefully, and then follow the instructions that come with the test kit. Or, hire a professional to conduct a comprehensive, open-ended assessment, including whether and how to sample.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

There is newfound concern with dust and its potential health effects, so it is important to remove dust from surfaces and minimize the amount of dust in the air.  Another major issue with dust is when there is also high humidity or damp spots in the house or on contents. Dampness and dust (as food for mold) go hand-in-hand with mold growth.

Determining if you have "mold" can be a difficult and disconcerting situation to be in. Because there is no definitive test for "mold," careful observation during an open-ended exploration can help to determine whether or not there is "mold." Or, if there are other exposure challenges in your house instead.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Dust is becoming a substance of growing interest in regards to health, especially indoors. Dust is more than what we think of as ordinary "house dust." Laboratory analysis of house dust has identified more than 200 substances ranging from sand, to sheet rock, to lint. Even pet dander, feathers, pieces of plants, pollen, mold spores and fragments, car tire particles, the rare asbestos fiber, charcoal, occasional metal fragments, plus tiny mites and their fecal pellets. In other words, respiratory irritants, allergens, asthma triggers, and COPD challenges.

Dust is most easily visible when accumulated on flat surfaces and can often be seen in the air in a bright shaft of sunlight. Less obvious dust accumulations are on vertical surfaces like walls and upside-down horizontal surfaces like ceilings. Dust accumulates in forced air systems and in their connected air ducts.

But recent research has discovered that these are not the most troublesome concerns about "dust." The dust that is too small to see comprises at least 99% of all the dust. These fine and ultra-fine particles easily pass through the sinuses, down the bronchial branches of the lungs, and deep into the smallest alveoli. The smallest particles can pass from the lungs and into the bloodstream much like oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Ultra-fine particulate has been reliably associated with cardiovascular disease. They have also been seen in the brain, having traveled from the nose up through the physical pathway of the olfactory nerve. Recent evidence suspects these with some declining brain function.

<strong>Dampness plus Dust </strong>
Dust is the most common source of nutrients for bacteria and mold growing in damp spots.

There are many misconceptions about mold, such as what it looks like and how it can affect people (or not). Common beliefs can incorrectly conclude the presence of mold growth when there is none. Other common beliefs can incorrectly conclude that mold cannot cause the complaints and health issues that occupants report. It is as important to know if you don't have "mold" as it is to know if you do, so that you don't waste time and money solving the "wrong" problem.

Water-damaged materials can release a wide variety of chemicals, particularly problematic for those with chemical intolerance.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Common "dusting" methods are usually sufficient to remove dust from most flat surfaces, including walls and ceilings. We recommend using a HEPA vacuum or wiping with a damp or microfiber-type cloth, so you don't stir up the dust back into the air. HEPA filtered air cleaners can be effective for reducing airborne dust as long as they genuine HEPA and properly sized for the area of concern.

Forced air blowers can also accumulate a thick coating of dust. All the air in the forced air system goes into and through the blower compartment, which is then dispersed into the living areas. Occasional cleaning of the ducting and the blower blades by a professional duct cleaning company can be helpful.  We recommend finding a company that follows one of the two standards for duct cleaning from either  NADCA (www.nadca.com) or AACA (www.acca.org).

The easiest management of the fine and ultra-fine dust is frequent cleaning. Walls and ceilings should be cleaned every 5-10 years, or more frequently if needed.  Ducts should be cleaned every 8-12 years or more frequently if needed.

Possible mold growth can be more complex to identify and address.  If you are noticing dust plus water stains, damp spots, or musty or "off" odors, a mold investigation is needed.

Water stains will most likely be near the source of a leak, usually on the opposite side from the source. In all cases, the reason for the dampness must be identified and stopped, to prevent new growth or further damage and discoloration from occurring.

Carefully check nearby locations for water pipes and leaks from roofs or around windows.  A simple moisture meter ($30) can be a useful tool for investigating damp conditions. <em> (Note: condensation from high humidity in bathrooms and laundry rooms more commonly result in visible mold growth rather than just staining.)</em>

If the stains are near a water pipe or where water is used, that will be the most likely source. If not, then consider a leak from the roof or around windows.  If the stained area does not measure dry with a moisture meter, or the stain keeps returning, then the moisture source is still active and there is a possibility of mold growth.

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

There are many misconceptions about mold, such as what it looks like and how it can affect people (or not). Common beliefs can incorrectly conclude the presence of mold growth when there is none. Other common beliefs can incorrectly conclude that mold cannot cause the complaints and health issues that occupants report. It is as important to know if you don't have "mold" as it is to know if you do, so that you don't waste time and money solving the "wrong" problem.

If there is "mold" then it's important to understand that exposure has been linked to a wide variety of health complaints in otherwise healthy people. Low level exposure can be particularly problematic for people who already have asthma, allergies, COPD, or other respiratory conditions. Non-respiratory complaints are also commonly reported by those living in damp houses.

Mold and moisture that has not been promptly and properly remediated can eventually lead to worsening health issues, plus damage to both the building structure and its contents. Continued neglect can further increase symptoms plus populations of bacteria, insects, and rodents. Water-damaged materials can release a wide variety of chemicals, particularly problematic for those with chemical intolerance.

<strong>General Procedures and Initial Information</strong>
Mold can grow only where there has been sufficient dampness long enough for the spores to germinate and grow. If you find the damp spots (or even the dried spots), you will also find any mold growth which may be present. The first step for determining if you have a mold problem is to explore, looking for the following clues:
<ul>
 	<li>Have there been any leaks, flooding, or condensation in the house?</li>
 	<li>Are there any unexplained damp spots on walls or ceilings?</li>
 	<li>Are there water stains on walls or ceilings?</li>
 	<li>Are there discolorations that partially wipe off, or smear, on the surface?</li>
 	<li>Are there musty or other "off" odors?</li>
</ul>
If you answer "no" to all of the above questions, then it is unlikely that you have "mold." If you answer "yes" to one or more, then the investigation which follow will be helpful.

<strong>Mold Testing</strong>
Although testing for mold is popular and the results can sometimes be helpful, the results can easily create more confusion than clarity.

Where should you collect the samples for lab analysis? Locating the damp spots (and other characteristics above) will identify the location for collecting the samples.

Which of the many sample types is best? There are more than a dozen combinations of samples types and lab analysis methods, each revealing a different part of the situation.

Because testing itself is not definitive, select carefully, and then follow the instructions that come with the test kit. Or, hire a professional to conduct a comprehensive, open-ended assessment, including whether and how to sample.

Shoes collect little bits of everything you walk through.  Wearing shoes inside your home leaves "footprints" of these onto your floors as you walk.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

We've all seen muddy footprints on our floors. But mud and dirt are not the only things our shoes track into our house. Shoes pickup little bits of everything we walk through such as oil, grease, grass, pollen, heavy metals, pesticides, and germs from public restroom floors.

Wearing shoes indoors can transfer all this, and more, directly onto your floors. Infants and children are particularly susceptible to exposure, as they crawl and play on the floor, putting their hands into their mouths. None of this promotes health.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Take your shoes off at the door. Alternately, use 2 doormats, one outside and one inside, to remove as much of the contaminants as possible before you walk through your house. Pets can also track in contaminants, so use doormats at the pet door or wipe your pet's paws after they've been outside. Vacuum at least weekly to remove the layers of history-impacted contaminants.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Stop smoking or vaping inside the house. If smoking/vaping is occurring outdoors, make sure it is well away from the house, especially open windows or vents.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Tobacco smoking produces dozens of chemicals, some of them known to be hazardous or carcinogenic, along with the usual combustion products. Vaping, while often considered to be safer, produces an entirely different combination of byproducts. In addition, vaping equipment allows the addition of user-preference chemicals to be vaporized, resulting in unpredictable and uncontrollable byproducts.

The combustion byproducts, composed of particles and chemicals, are directly inhaled by the person smoking or vaping. But they can also be inhaled by those near them, referred to as second-hand smoke. In addition, those same byproducts accumulate on surfaces and contents, like curtains or upholstery, and are then slowly released into the air over time, creating an ongoing source of third-hand exposure. All three types of exposure have been associated with eventual long-term illness and disease in people. Immediate risks are to be expected with people who have asthma, other breathing conditions, or chemical intolerance.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "Smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body" and "is the leading cause of preventable death."

Routinely clean floors using a dry mop with a microfiber washable cloth or a vacuum with a nozzle or head designed for bare floors to keep dust and dirt from getting into the air.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Removing dust and dirt (which can contain known allergens and asthma triggers) from smooth surface flooring is important to prevent their accumulation in corners and behind furniture. It also minimizes the amount of dust and dirt that is disturbed and gets into the air you breathe.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

We recommend regular cleaning using a microfiber washable cloth-type mop, or a HEPA vacuum fitted with a head or nozzle designed for bare floors. Surface cleaning with a broom or regular dry mop will disturb the dust, sending it into the air as you remove it. Depending on your personal sensitivity to dust, you may find that you need to clean smooth flooring more frequently than carpet because the dust is more readily visible and more easily disturbed into the air.

If you use a wet method, warm water with a bit of non-fragranced detergent is usually adequate. Special cleaning agents with harsh chemicals and fragrances are rarely needed and can create irritation of the respiratory system, including possible asthma attacks.

Keep your carpet clean with a HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner

Vacuum your carpet (see Notes) 

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1730

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Carpets cannot be kept clean without an adequate vacuum cleaner used at least once a week. A HEPA-filtered exhaust is required to prevent the fine and ultra-fine "dust" from blowing back into the air. Brooms, hand-held vacuums, or "carpet sweepers" are inadequate for deep cleaning. They are sufficient only for surface removal of visible debris.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Carpets accumulate and trap dirt and particulate such as mold, heavy metals, pet dander, and pollen, that can trigger asthma, allergies, or other health conditions. Regular removal of the dust and dirt from carpets is important to prevent their accumulation below the surface and penetration into the pad. At the same time, walking on the carpet will also propel "dust" from below the surface into the air.

A vacuum cleaner has two jobs. It must remove "dust" from the carpet AND it must also collect that "dust" in a bag or container. Otherwise, the "dust" will just blow back into the room where the larger, visible particles will quickly re-settle back onto the carpet. The smaller particles (which can comprise up to 99 percent of all the dust) is too small to see and can remain airborne for hours until it slowly re-settles onto all horizontal surfaces. While it remains airborne, people and pets can inhale it, potentially irritating nose and throat and triggering allergies, asthma, or other health conditions.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Wall-to-wall carpet must be vacuumed regularly, preferably at least once a week.  A HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner keeps the fine dust from blowing back into the air.

Regular vacuum cleaner bags or other capture devices are only capable of collecting only the debris that is big enough to see, plus a small portion of what is too small to see.  In many cases, this can mean that the vast majority of dust that is too small to see is blown right back into the room.

In order to also capture the maximum amount of smaller, non-visible dust, which can penetrate into the deepest areas of the lungs, we recommend a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA-filtered exhaust. In other words, an appropriate vacuum cleaner needs two ways to capture the dirt it pulls from the carpet: A bag or container for the visible "dust," and a HEPA filter for the tiny, breathable particles. A HEPA filter will remove "99.97%  of particles at 0.3 microns." If you see language that says "as small as" or "down to," the filter is NOT the same as a genuine HEPA even if the word "HEPA" is used on the packaging.

Carpets should be vacuumed at least once a week, using slow movements.  You may need to vacuum more frequently if your household contains many people and/or pets.

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Not all vacuum cleaners are alike. The one you use may be great but it helps to be sure because some clean different types of floor better than others. But the most important feature is how well they prevent dust and dirt that is too small to see from blowing out the exhaust and back into the air you breathe.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Carpets accumulate and trap dirt and particulate such as mold, heavy metals, pet dander, and pollen, that can trigger asthma, allergies, or other health conditions. Regular removal of both the surface and embedded dust and dirt is important to prevent their accumulation below the surface and their penetration into the pad below.

A vacuum cleaner has three jobs. It must remove "dust" and dirt from the carpet AND it must also keep that "dust" in a bag or container for easy disposal. The third job is to prevent the smallest dust, that which is too small to see, from blowing out the exhaust and back into the room.

Regular vacuum cleaner bags or other capture devices are only capable of collecting the debris that is big enough to see, plus a small portion of what is too small to see. This can mean that most of the dust you think is being captured is blown right back into the room.

The smaller particles, which are up to 99 percent of all the dust, are too small to see. Because of their small size they can remain airborne for hours - and easily inhaled - until they slowly re-settle back onto the carpet and other horizontal surfaces.

While it remains airborne, people and pets can inhale it, potentially irritating nose and throat and triggering allergies, asthma, or other health conditions. In order to also capture the smaller, non-visible dust - which can penetrate into the deepest areas of the lungs - the vacuum cleaner needs a HEPA-filtered exhaust.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Find all your vacuums and look at the back and underside for an identification plate or other indication of the manufacturer and specific model number.  A quick internet search should be able to provide details about the product, most importantly if the vacuum has a HEPA filter.  If your vacuum is more than 10 years old, it may be time to upgrade the unit anyway.

In order to also capture the smaller, non-visible dust - which can penetrate into the deepest areas of the lungs - the vacuum cleaner needs a HEPA-filtered exhaust.

A HEPA filter is required because it removes 99.97% of particulates at 0.3 microns. Note that some manufacturers use words like "as small as 0.3" or "down to 0.3." These are not the same as "at 0.3."

The differences can be especially important if you have asthma or other respiratory conditions that cause you to be reactive to particulates.  If you aren't sensitive, other types of filters, sometimes called "HEPA-style" or "True HEPA", may meet your needs.

In other words, an appropriate vacuum cleaner needs two ways to capture the dirt it pulls from the carpet: A bag or container for the visible "dust," and a HEPA filter for the non-visible, respirable particles.

Remove cleaning supplies from the bedroom

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1785

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Remove cleaning supplies from the bedroom to minimize direct exposure to chemicals and risk of related health impacts, especially during sleep.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Containers of cleaning supplies aren't always tightly sealed and can release small but significant amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other chemicals into the air, where they circulate and combine with each other along with all other chemical sources in the house. This can result in an ongoing, low-level exposure.

Long-term exposure to even low levels of  VOCs and other chemicals can pose health risks as triggers for asthma and other health conditions.

Even those products labeled "zero VOC" or "non-toxic" can still pose a potential risk of exposure because not all VOCs must be declared. This is why zero VOC products can still have a noticeable odor. The specific non-disclosed VOCs can vary with different manufacturers. This is why they not only smell different from each other but also why individuals with chemical intolerance can react to one brand but not another.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Inspect closets and cabinets in the bedroom, and gather all your cleaning supplies into one well-ventilated location. Safely dispose of any containers that are rusted, leaky, or otherwise damaged. Ideally, cleaning supplies should be stored completely outside of the house in a storage shed or detached garage. If that is not possible, store your supplies in an attached garage or inside the house, and make sure individual containers are each tightly sealed and then store in airtight bins or other sealable containers.

You may need to store certain chemicals separately from each other to minimize interactions which could lead to safety risks and additional health risks. Check all labels for safe storage conditions and warnings about hazards.

The most effective step you can take is to buy cleaning supplies with as few chemicals as possible. Avoid ingredients including fragrance, terpenes, D-limonene, and other chemicals you don't know.

Remove paint/art supplies from your bedroom to minimize exposure to low-level chemical fumes which can be inhaled directly, especially while sleeping.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Paint and other art supplies are often in containers that are not tightly sealed and can release small but significant amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other chemicals into the air, where they circulate and combine with each other along with all other chemical sources in the house. This can result in an ongoing, low-level exposure, especially since you spend extended periods of time in the bedroom.

Long-term exposure to even low levels of  VOCs and other chemicals can pose health risks as triggers for asthma and other health conditions.

Even products labeled "zero VOC" or "non-toxic" can still pose a potential risk of exposure because not all VOCs must be declared.

Remove paint/art supplies from storage locations inside the house to minimize exposure to low-level chemical fumes.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Paint and art supplies are in often in containers that are not tightly sealed and can release small but significant amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other chemicals into the air, where they circulate and combine with each other along with all other chemical sources in the house. This can result in an ongoing, low-level exposure.

Long-term exposure to even low levels of  VOCs and other chemicals can pose health risks as triggers for asthma and other health conditions.

Even those products labeled "zero VOC" or "non-toxic" can still pose a potential risk of exposure because not all VOCs must be declared. This is why zero VOC paint and art supplies can still have a noticeable odor. The specific non-disclosed VOCs can vary with different manufacturers. This is why they not only smell different from each other but also why individuals with chemical intolerance can react to one brand but not another.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Inspect all rooms of the house, including closets and cabinets, and gather all your paints and art supplies into one well-ventilated location. Safely dispose of any containers that are rusted, leaky, or otherwise damaged.

Ideally, all supplies should be stored completely outside of the house in a storage shed or detached garage. If that is not possible, and you store your supplies in an attached garage or have to store them inside the house, make sure individual containers are tightly sealed and then store in airtight bins or other containers.

You may need to store certain chemicals separately from each other to minimize interactions which could lead to safety risks and additional health risks. Check all labels for safe storage conditions and warnings about hazards.

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Even though your paint and art supplies are not stored in the living space of your house, they are still stored inside the indirect airspace of your house. As much as 50% of the air we breathe comes from or through the garage, basement, or crawlspace.  The containers of your paint or art supplies are not always airtight, allowing the chemicals to escape into the air and circulate throughout the rest of the house.

These small but significant amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other chemicals are released into the air, where they circulate and combine with each other along with all other chemical sources where they are stored plus others in the house. This can result in an ongoing, low-level exposure.

Long-term exposure to even low levels of  VOCs and other chemicals can pose health risks as triggers for asthma and other health conditions.

e-1885

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Fertilizers or pesticides stored inside the house, especially in the bedrooms, are a hazard for everyone and can be especially problematic if you are chemically sensitive.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Fertilizers and pesticides pose a potential risk of a hazardous exposure. The active and inert ingredients can be any in a large range of substances, some of which are identified by different names for the same substance. Not all of which are always required to be disclosed.

This is especially true for pesticides. The active ingredient is almost always below 1 percent of the total. That means the inert ingredients will be more than 99 percent of the product. Because the inert ingredients are not required to be disclosed, you will have no idea what is actually in the product.  You won't know what you are exposed to.

We do not recommend storing pesticides or fertilizers anywhere in the house, including an attached garage, basement, or crawlspace. These spaces are not typically air sealed from the living spaces, which means air will circulate between them and the air you breathe in the living space.  A continuing series of studies have measured as much as 50% or more of the air we breathe in the living space come from or through basements and crawlspaces, bringing along chemical contaminants from stored pesticides and fertilizers.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Inspect all areas inside the house, not just the known locations, especially under sinks and cabinets in the laundry room. Carefully collect and remove immediately to storage outside the house, like a detached garage or shed.

It is important to understand that basements, crawlspaces, and attached garages are not considered to be outside the house. They are inside the building envelope, and whatever chemicals get into the air in those spaces can and will circulate throughout the living spaces in the house exposing occupants.

If they must be stored anywhere inside, enclose them in an airtight container so any fumes or leakage remain contained. You may need to store certain chemicals separately from each other to minimize health and safety risks. Safely dispose of any damaged containers.

In addition, keep pesticides stored in cool, dry, and well-lit areas. The storage area should prevent temperature extremes as very high or very low temperatures can cause pesticide deterioration.  Don't store pesticides near food, potable water, animal feed, medical supplies, clothing, seed, fertilizers, or gasoline. This will prevent contamination of these products from vapors, dust, or spills, and reduce the likelihood of accidental human, animal, or environmental exposure.

Call the National Poison Center Number: 1-800-222-1222 with any concerns about exposure by ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact.

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1915

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Fragrances and other chemicals in cleaning, laundry, and personal care products are easily inhaled into your lungs or absorbed into your skin. They can be especially problematic for people with asthma or chemical sensitivity. Switching to unscented, less-toxic products reduces risk of exposure and associated health impacts.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Most common household cleaners, laundry, and personal care products contain dozens of the 80,000 plus chemicals in active use today. Most names on the list are hard to pronounce and even more difficult to identify.  Effects on the body are only beginning to be known, as sufficient studies have been conducted on only a few thousand individual chemicals and almost none on the many combinations. But studies that have been done have shown associations between some of these chemicals, especially fragrances, and asthma, allergic reactions, respiratory and skin irritation, headaches, "foggy" thinking, muscle and joint complaints, and hormone disruption.  Some are known to accumulate in human tissue without harm until years later. Continued exposure to these chemical sources of exposure can gradually, or sometimes suddenly, trigger chronic reactivity.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Buy only fragrance-free laundry, general cleaning, and personal care products. Read labels carefully. Products labelled "natural," "green," and "eco-friendly" can still contain fragrances and other chemicals of concern.  Even products labelled "unscented" can contain fragrance(s) designed to mask another scent.  For more information on choosing products with less health risk visit:

Eliminate cockroaches

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-1930

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Cockroaches can present significant health risks and should be eliminated from your house preferably using non-chemical methods.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

An infestation of any pest is a demonstration that the environment inside the home is more conducive for the survival of the pests than for the health of you and your family.

Actions to change the environmental conditions inside your home back to what is healthier for people is fundamental. And, those actions should not replace the pest problem with toxic chemicals and their own set of health risks.

Cockroaches can be potent, and sometimes fatal,  asthma trigger and for allergy sensitization. In addition, they can be carriers of disease by contaminating food.

The disease risk is mostly limited to food rather than directly to people. Cockroach bodies and legs can pick up bacteria from rotting food, garbage, bathrooms, and other filthy locations. Those bacteria can then be transferred to food if the cockroach crawls in or through it.

Action should always be taken to remove cockroach infestations and prevent their return as soon as possible. However, chemical pest treatment methods can also impact human health, so it is important to choose a treatment protocol that doesn't do more "damage" than the pest itself.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Cockroaches, like all indoor pests, are seeking the best locations for food, water, and shelter. Remove the source(s) of food and water while preventing them from coming inside is the most effective prevention. Once you have eliminated cockroaches it is just as important to clean up the remains and droppings (frass) from the cockroaches. These remains are the trigger for asthma and allergies rather than the cockroach itself.

These are some of the principles of a non-poisonous alternative called Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Practicing IPM can be very effective for preventing future intrusions and infestations. Many professional pest control companies now include IPM in their list of services.

Eliminate mice / rats

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Mice or rats can present significant health risks and should be eliminated from your house preferably using non-chemical methods and prevented from returning.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Mice and rats are unsanitary and present a known health risk. Their droppings can carry disease, plus their dander and dried urine can be allergy and asthma triggers. Rodents can damage the insulation on electrical wires creating a potential fire hazard, make nests in the attic or wall insulation, contaminate forced air ducts and damage your belongings. An infestation of mice or rates is an indication that the environment inside the home is more conducive for the health of the pests and no longer a healthy environment for the people.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

The basic principles are to observe a pest infestation, identify the type of pest, explore options for stopping the pest from continuing living in your house, then execute the non-toxic, non-chemical methods that have been shown to work. Start by looking for and removing food and water sources (inside and outside) and weatherizing your house, sealing up cracks and holes.

It is rare to have a single mouse or rat. They live in communities and reproduce rapidly. The condition should be evaluated immediately by a professional to determine the extent of the condition.

Chemical pesticides are dangerous to you and your family and your pets and considered not effective because the rodents can relocate to another area in the home. Rats are very intelligent and cautious of pesticides. Traps may eliminate a few rodents but are more of an indicator that you have mice or rats not a successful way to eliminate them.

To eliminate the pests we recommend Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM can be very effective for eliminating and preventing future intrusions and infestations. Many professional pest control companies now include IPM in their list of services.

Once you have eliminated the mice or rats it is just as important to clean up the remains and droppings. These remains can trigger asthma and allergies. If the condition was an infestation a professional should remove the remains and anything soiled, like the attic or crawlspace insulation. A professional should evaluate the damage, rodents can destroy electrical wires, insulation, ductwork and contaminate anything in that area.

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Bats present serious known health risks and should be professionally eliminated and prevented from returning. Public health agencies may require evacuation of the building until the bats have been removed.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Bats can carry rabies which is a serious and painful disease that can result in death if not quickly and properly treated. In addition, histoplasmosis can result from exposure to the bat dropping (guano) that accumulates where the colony lives. Histoplasmosis is a serious lung infection for people and can occasionally be fatal.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Because of the high risk for transmission of potentially fatal diseases we strongly recommend a professional exterminator evaluate and generate a plan to eliminate the bats, their guano, and prevent their return.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is the least toxic pest management program available.  Learn more about IPM <a href="https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/integrated-pest-management-ipm-principles">from the EPA</a> and <a href="https://www.beyondpesticides.org/resources/safety-source-on-pesticide-providers/what-is-integrated-pest-management">Beyond Pesticides.</a>

We recommend caution if you perform an initial evaluation of the situation.  Wear appropriate protective, disposable clothing, eye protection (goggles are recommended), and a mask with a respirator (minimum N95).

Once you have eliminated the bats it is just as important to clean up the remains and droppings. If the condition was an infestation a professional should remove the remains and anything soiled, like the attic or crawlspace insulation.

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-2030

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

The use of chemical pesticides indoors is never recommended, even when applied as directed, because it exposes people and pets to chemicals for up to several days. Instead, focus on pest prevention and if treatment is needed, use non-toxic options.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Pesticides are chemically designed to kill by interfering with some portion of the life cycle or the reproductive function of a living organism. People are living organisms so that means there is a potential risk of some sort of interference also, though at less than a lethal level.  Chemicals in pesticides are known health hazard and frequent, recurring indoor chemical treatments can impact the health of occupants.  The contents of an aerosol or spray will be inhaled, causing direct exposure through the lungs. Handling liquid pesticides creates exposure to the skin, resulting in absorption exposure into the body. Children and pets are particularly vulnerable to pesticide poisoning because they are not aware of the harm.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Start by keeping pests out of your home by removing food and water sources and closing openings from outside by sealing up cracks and holes.

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Pesticides, whether intended for us outdoors or indoors, are chemically designed to kill by interfering with some portion of the life cycle or the reproductive function of a living organism. People are living organisms also so that means there is a potential risk of some sort of interference also, though at less than a lethal level.  Chemicals in pesticides are known health hazard and outdoor pesticides can be tracked indoors on shoes and pet's paws and then become embedded in carpet fibers, so you may be exposed to the chemicals more than you suspect.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Use chemical pesticides outdoors only when absolutely necessary, not routinely or on a recurring contract. If you do use them, keep windows and doors closed while an application is occurring.  Double up on doormats (one inside and one outside) at all entrance points and remove and leave shoes at the door to prevent pesticides from being tracked inside. Also, wipe off pets' paws before they come indoors.

Many pests can be controlled and prevented with non-chemical means by Integrated Pest Management (IPM).  It is the least toxic pest management program available and can be implemented by occupants.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Some flea treatment options are quite toxic so choose the least-toxic but effective treatment option and prevent contaminating the house.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Flea treatments are designed to kill by interfering with some portion of the life cycle or the reproductive function of a living organism. Since people are also living organisms that means there is a potential risk of some sort of interference, though at less than a lethal level as it is for fleas. Many of the pesticides allowed for use on pets are linked to serious health issues in people, such as cancer, neurological, and respiratory problems. This is especially true for children and pregnant women.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Regular bathing of your pet with a non-fragranced pet shampoo or soap is usually enough to kill adult fleas and their eggs. Washing pet bedding weekly in hot water and regular wiping down and vacuuming of pet-frequented surfaces helps prevent infestation. If you have an ongoing flea issue or an infestation consult your veterinarian for the least-toxic treatment or preventive treatment. Remember, some pesticides that are safe for dogs may not be safe for cats or other pets so read labels carefully and follow manufacturer's directions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Flea treatments are designed to kill by interfering with some portion of the life cycle or the reproductive function of a living organism. Since people are also living organisms that means there is a potential risk of some sort of interference, though at less than a lethal level. Many of the pesticides allowed for use on pets are linked to serious health issues in people, such as cancer and neurological and respiratory problems, particularly for children and pregnant women. Some chemical pesticides are also dangerous for pets.

Most whole-house treatments for fleas, often called "flea bombs," use toxic chemicals. Chemical treatment for pests indoors also exposes people to the chemicals, especially sprays or fogs which are airborne. Do your research and then choose the least-toxic but effective treatment to protect your pet and yourself. What you don't want to do is risk contaminating your entire house and all its contents.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Fleas can usually be managed without chemical treatment with a two-pronged strategy that treats both your pet (who can be carrying the fleas) and your house (where an infestation can occur).

We do not recommend chemical flea bombs. They are not that effective and spread the pesticide to the entire house, including areas that do not have fleas.  They also expose you to the pesticide, sometimes for days. Plus, this type of treatment does not end the infestation on the skin of your pet, which can cause a re-infestation of the house.

Consult your veterinarian for the best ways to safely remove fleas from your pets. Thorough vacuuming of carpets and furniture will remove enough fleas and enough of their food to prevent their continued reproduction and eventual death. You should also wash your pet's bedding in hot water weekly or more often if needed.  For more information on non-toxic ways to protect your home and pet from fleas, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/nontoxic-ways-protect-your-pet">click here</a>.

condensation in the laundry room
New Action - Yes Notice condensation in your laundry room?

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Condensation from high humidity in the laundry room can be from the washer or the dryer and should be addressed to avoid mold and long-term damage to building materials.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Insufficient removal of high moisture from rooms like the laundry room can cause frequent condensation on walls, ceilings, and other surfaces. This condensed moisture, combined with dust creates a condition which can support mold and bacterial growth - and eventually even physical damage to building materials if allowed to continue.

High moisture and the growth of mold and bacteria, even when not visible, can lead to a variety of health symptoms and can be particularly impactful for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), there is sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure of damp indoor environments to upper respiratory symptoms and asthma symptoms in sensitized people.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Evaluating the condition may be easy (depending if you need to access the attic) but upgrading the fan, if needed, is a more challenging repair and may require a professional handyman or contractor.

Condensation on wall or ceilings in the laundry room is an indication of at least one of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>The dryer is not exhausting or not exhausting sufficiently to the outside</li>
 	<li>A small laundry room area and use of the washer on hot</li>
 	<li>There is no exhaust fan or either the exhaust fan is not working properly or sized correctly</li>
 	<li>There is a cold surface where the condensation occurs</li>
</ul>
It is very important to make sure that the dryer is vented directly outdoors, and not into the crawlspace or attic. The dryer removes about 3-7 gallons of water per load. If the dryer exhaust duct was clogged with lint, kinked or not exhausting to the exterior will put a significant amount of moisture into the laundry room and house.

The best way to check the dryer exhaust is while drying some clothes, go outside, and find the exhaust vent. If you can't find it, check the attic and crawlspace. If you can find it outside, a flap (called a damper) will push open as the air blows through it. You should also be able to feel the air blowing out with your hand if accessible. Some dryers exhaust to the roof. Dryer exhaust fans should have a damper to prevent air from flowing back into the house and prevents birds from nesting in the opening. They should not have a screen or grill at the opening, this will collect lint.

The dryer exhaust should be evaluated to make sure it is not clogged. This reduces the efficiency, makes drying time long and be a fire risk.

If your laundry room does not have a duct for the exhaust and the dryer exhausts into the laundry room or has an alternative device at the end of dryer duct (typically a container with water), all the moisture from the dryer is staying in the laundry room and the house.

If there is an exhaust fan try running the fan at least 40 minutes. For convenience, you may want to install an inexpensive timer switch which will automatically shut off the exhaust fan after a pre-set amount of time. Or, install a humidity controlled fan switch so the fan runs until the humidity is sufficiently reduced. If you're operating the fan but still notice condensation, check that the fan is actually removing air from the room. Just being able to hear the fan isn't enough. An easy way to check is to place a single piece of toilet tissue against the vent when the fan is running. If the tissue "sticks," it is a good indication that the fan is removing air.

One other condition to evaluate is moisture condensates on surfaces that are cold enough for the vapor to change to a liquid. If you have condensation on only some surfaces the wall or ceiling may be cold enough to allow condensation. The wall or ceiling may have missing insulation or air leakage that causes the wall to get cold. If the fan is running properly, then check for other large moisture sources in the vicinity such as frequent cooking in an adjacent kitchen. Make sure those areas have their own sufficient ventilation, especially while moisture generating activities are occurring.

Stop current leaks now! Double-check area of damage from current/recent leak
Current or recent small leaks that dried were identified and should be addressed.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Current or recent small leaks that have dried should still be fully evaluated and remediated.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Water damage from leaks, flooding, sewage, and condensation has perhaps the most negative impact on health of occupants, with later damage to materials and contents of buildings. Left unresolved, water damage can create chronic health effects in people and weaken the structural integrity of buildings.

A 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine, Damp Indoor Spaces and Health, identified potential health effects from growth of bacteria, mold, infestations of insects and rodents, plus the release of chemicals from the water damaged materials. The 2008 AIHA book Recognition, Evaluation, and Control of Indoor Mold stated, in part: "moisture is the primary environmental condition associated with disease" and that the "prevention of unwanted moisture, and removal of filth caused by moisture, is necessary to prevent disease."

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Stop any active or current leaks immediately before they become a major repair.
Current or recent small leaks, even with minor or moderate damage that has been addressed, can have additional damage around the area that may not be visible. If the area was not professionally remediated the conditions can often remain as a trigger for symptoms. Verify any previous remediation of recent leak(s) was complete for all the damage. Our recommendation is to evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40) and remediate additional areas if necessary. For both current and past leaks, you may need a professional to review the conditions and remediate as needed especially if you continue to smell musty/moldy odors near the area.

General Principles of Managing Leaks and Restoration:
Addressing water damage of all types are basically the same. The specific details can be determined only by an on-site inspection and assessment. Whether the water source is from leaks, flooding, or sewage the fundamentals are below:

Evaluate the wet materials to determine if they are water damaged with mold growth or are only water stained. The latter can usually be dried and sufficiently cleaned. It is also important to clearly identify everywhere the water may have traveled. Water rarely stays where it started, spreading in often unpredictable ways, with additional damage around the perimeter and may not be visible. The following are necessary for a successful water damage remediation:

• The source of the water is identified and stopped.
• The previously wet building materials are comletely dried.
• The previously wet materials have not been damaged beyond water stains.
• None of the previously damp areas have what looks like visible mold growth.
• Check beyond the boundaries of what you know to have been wet for additional areas that got wet. Evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40).
• Pay particular attention to where the water touched walls and cabinet supports, or cracks and seams in flooring. Because if the water reached those features then it absolutely will have traveled to other areas the full extent of the water paths need ot be evaluated.
• Clean, disinfect, and/or remediate all areas as necessary.

If all of the above have been verified, then typically nothing else is needed. However, if you indicated there are respiratory or other reactions with anyone in your family, then further investigation is necessary. Download the Moisture Action Plan.

Old leaks that were not dried in less than 48 hours, can have additional damage that may not be visible. If the major damage was not professionally remediated it can often remain as a trigger for symptoms. We recommend having a professional verify any previous repairs that were completed and confirm no additional remediation is necessary especially if you smell any musty/moldy odors. Major damage may require structural repairs. 

General Principles of Managing Leaks and Restoration:
Addressing water damage of all types are basically the same. The specific details can be determined only by an on-site inspection and assessment. Whether the water source is from leaks, flooding, or sewage the fundamentals are below:

Evaluate the wet materials to determine if they are water damaged with mold growth or are only water stained. The latter can usually be dried and sufficiently cleaned. It is also important to clearly identify everywhere the water may have traveled. Water rarely stays where it started, spreading in often unpredictable ways, with additional damage around the perimeter and may not be visible. The following are necessary for a successful water damage remediation:

• The source of the water is identified and stopped.
• The previously wet building materials are comletely dried. 
• The previously wet materials have not been damaged beyond water stains. 
• None of the previously damp areas have what looks like visible mold growth.
• Check beyond the boundaries of what you know to have been wet for additional areas that got wet. Evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40). 
• Pay particular attention to where the water touched walls and cabinet supports, or cracks and seams in flooring. Because if the water reached those features then it absolutely will have traveled to other areas the full extent of the water paths need ot be evaluated.
• Clean, disinfect, and/or remediate all areas as necessary.
If all of the above have been verified, then typically nothing else is needed. However, if you indicated there are respiratory or other reactions with anyone in your family, then further investigation is necessary. Download the Moisture Action Plan.

Stop the seasonal leak!
Seasonal or recurring leak(s) need to be repaired before the damage is remediated.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Water damage from leaks, flooding, sewage, and condensation has perhaps the most negative impact on health of occupants, with later damage to materials and contents of buildings. Left unresolved, water damage can create chronic health effects in people and weaken the structural integrity of buildings. 

A 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine, Damp Indoor Spaces and Health, identified potential health effects from growth of bacteria, mold, infestations of insects and rodents, plus the release of chemicals from the water damaged materials.  The 2008 AIHA book Recognition, Evaluation, and Control of Indoor Mold stated, in part: "moisture is the primary environmental condition associated with disease" and that the "prevention of unwanted moisture, and removal of filth caused by moisture, is necessary to prevent disease."

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Stop the seasonal or recurring leak!  Even if they are dried quickly, seasonal or recurring small leaks can have additional damage around the area that may not be visible. If the leak is not repaired, each additional seasonal leak can increase the damage and the leak could become larger. Any areas that have mold growth (visible or not) will become re-hydrated during additional leaks. This can often remain as a trigger for symptoms. 
First, identify and stop the reason for the leak. Evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40) and monitor the area for musty/moldy odors. You may need professional assistance to fix the leak, remediate damage, and/or verify that previous remediation efforts were sufficient.

The seasonal or recurrent small leak was not dried quickly. The reoccuring leak(s) need to be repaired before the damage is remediated by a professional.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Seasonal or recurrent small leaks with major damage that were not dried in less than 48 hours potentially have three additional risks: 
1. They remain as a trigger for symptoms. 
2. The next seasonal leak could increase the damage from major to catastrophic. Damaged areas that dried out will be rehydrated  in the next water leak.
3. The size of the leak itself can increase from small to large.

The 2008 AIHA book Recognition, Evaluation, and Control of Indoor Mold stated, in part: "moisture is the primary environmental condition associated with disease" and that the "prevention of unwanted moisture, and removal of filth caused by moisture, is necessary to prevent disease."

Old large leaks with minor or moderate visible damage can have additional damage that may not be visible. If the area was not completely remediated the conditions can often remain as a trigger for symptoms  We recommend having a professional verify any previous repairs that were completed and confirm no additional remediation is necessary. Monitor the area(s) closely for musty/moldy odors. 

General Principles of Managing Leaks and Restoration:
Addressing water damage of all types are basically the same. The specific details can be determined only by an on-site inspection and assessment. Whether the water source is from leaks, flooding, or sewage the fundamentals are below:

Evaluate the wet materials to determine if they are water damaged with mold growth or are only water stained. The latter can usually be dried and sufficiently cleaned. It is also important to clearly identify everywhere the water may have traveled. Water rarely stays where it started, spreading in often unpredictable ways, with additional damage around the perimeter and may not be visible. The following are necessary for a successful water damage remediation:

• The source of the water is identified and stopped.
• The previously wet building materials are comletely dried. 
• The previously wet materials have not been damaged beyond water stains. 
• None of the previously damp areas have what looks like visible mold growth.
• Check beyond the boundaries of what you know to have been wet for additional areas that got wet. Evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40). 
• Pay particular attention to where the water touched walls and cabinet supports, or cracks and seams in flooring. Because if the water reached those features then it absolutely will have traveled to other areas the full extent of the water paths need ot be evaluated.
• Clean, disinfect, and/or remediate all areas as necessary..

If all of the above have been verified, then typically nothing else is needed. However, if you indicated there are respiratory or other reactions with anyone in your family, then further investigation is necessary. Download the Moisture Action Plan.

Stop any active or current sewage leaks immediately before they become a major repair. Leaks that cause minor or moderate visible damage can also cause additional damage that may not be visible. If not completely remediated and disinfected, these conditions can often remain as a trigger for symptoms and may worsen over time. A toilet overflow requires that the cause of the water be fixed followed by cleaning and thorough drying of the area. Backflow from the street requires that the area also be thoroughly disinfected after cleaning but before drying (professional recommended). Depending on severity, professional assistance may be necessary to disinfect and remediate current leaks and/or to verify that previous remediation and disinfection was complete and sufficient.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Stop any active or current sewage leaks immediately before they become a major repair. Leaks that cause minor or moderate visible damage can also cause additional damage that may not be visible, especially if the orignial leak was not dried in 48 hours. If not completely remediated and disinfected, these conditions can often remain as a trigger for symptoms and damage may worsen over time. A toilet overflow requires that the cause of the water be fixed followed by cleaning and thorough drying of the area. Backflow from the street requires that the area be thoroughly disinfected after cleaning but before drying (professional recommended). Depending on severity, professional assistance may be necessary to disinfect and remediate current leaks and/or to verify that previous remediation and disinfection was complete and sufficient.

General Principles of Managing Leaks and Restoration:
Addressing water damage of all types are basically the same. The specific details can be determined only by an on-site inspection and assessment. Whether the water source is from leaks, flooding, or sewage the fundamentals are below:

Evaluate the wet materials to determine if they are water damaged with mold growth or are only water stained. The latter can usually be dried and sufficiently cleaned. It is also important to clearly identify everywhere the water may have traveled. Water rarely stays where it started, spreading in often unpredictable ways, with additional damage around the perimeter and may not be visible. The following are necessary for a successful water damage remediation:

• The source of the water is identified and stopped.
• The previously wet building materials are comletely dried. 
• The previously wet materials have not been damaged beyond water stains. 
• None of the previously damp areas have what looks like visible mold growth.
• Check beyond the boundaries of what you know to have been wet for additional areas that got wet. Evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40). 
• Pay particular attention to where the water touched walls and cabinet supports, or cracks and seams in flooring. Because if the water reached those features then it absolutely will have traveled to other areas the full extent of the water paths need ot be evaluated.
• Clean, disinfect, and/or remediate all areas as necessary.

If all of the above have been verified, then typically nothing else is needed. However, if you indicated there are respiratory or other reactions with anyone in your family, then further investigation is necessary. Download the Moisture Action Plan.

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Water damage from leaks, flooding, sewage, and condensation has perhaps the most negative impact on health of occupants, with later damage to materials and contents of buildings. Left unresolved, water damage can create chronic health effects in people and weaken the structural integrity of buildings.

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Stop any active or current sewage leaks immediately before they cause catastrophic damage. Leaks that cause major visible damage can likely cause additional damage that may not be visible. If not completely, dried, remediated and disinfected, these conditions can often remain as a trigger for symptoms and damage may worsen over time. A toilet overflow requires that the cause of the water be fixed followed by cleaning and thorough drying of the area.

Sewage is contaminated and potentially infectious. The most recent seasonal or recurrent major sewage leak with major damage was dried and should be evaluated, cleaned and remediated if needed

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Stop the seasonal or recurring sewege leak! 
The seasonal or recurring sewage leak was dried quickly but should be evaluated, cleaned, disinfected and remediated is needed . Sewage from toilet overflow or backflow from the street is contaminated and potentially infectious. We recommend a professional when it is a seasonal or recurring sewege leak and has major damage.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Water damage from leaks, flooding, sewage, and condensation has perhaps the most negative impact on health of occupants, with later damage to materials and contents of buildings. Left unresolved, water damage can create chronic health effects in people and weaken the structural integrity of buildings. 

A 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine, Damp Indoor Spaces and Health, identified potential health effects from growth of bacteria, mold, infestations of insects and rodents, plus the release of chemicals from the water damaged materials.  The 2008 AIHA book Recognition, Evaluation, and Control of Indoor Mold stated, in part: "moisture is the primary environmental condition associated with disease" and that the "prevention of unwanted moisture, and removal of filth caused by moisture, is necessary to prevent disease."

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Stop the seasonal or recurring sewage leak immediately. A toilet overflow requires that the cause of the water be fixed followed by cleaning and thorough drying of the area. Backflow from the street requires that the area also be thoroughly disinfected after cleaning but before drying (professional recommended). Seasonal or recurring leaks that caused major visible damage, even if dried in less than 48 hours, can also cause additional damage that may not be visible. If the leak isn't stopped, each additional leak can increase the damage and re-hydrate any areas that have mold growth (visible or not). If not completely dried, disinfected, and remediated, these conditions can often remain as a trigger for symptoms and cause more damage over time. First, identify and stop the reason for the sewage leak. Then we recommend having a professional verify any previous remediation and disinfection was completed before drying as well as to disinfect and remediate additional areas if necessary. Major damage may require structural repairs.

General Principles of Managing Leaks and Restoration:
Addressing water damage of all types are basically the same. The specific details can be determined only by an on-site inspection and assessment. Whether the water source is from leaks, flooding, or sewage the fundamentals are below:

Evaluate the wet materials to determine if they are water damaged with mold growth or are only water stained. The latter can usually be dried and sufficiently cleaned. It is also important to clearly identify everywhere the water may have traveled. Water rarely stays where it started, spreading in often unpredictable ways, with additional damage around the perimeter and may not be visible. The following are necessary for a successful water damage remediation:

• The source of the water is identified and stopped.
• The previously wet building materials are comletely dried. 
• The previously wet materials have not been damaged beyond water stains. 
• None of the previously damp areas have what looks like visible mold growth.
• Check beyond the boundaries of what you know to have been wet for additional areas that got wet. Evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40). 
• Pay particular attention to where the water touched walls and cabinet supports, or cracks and seams in flooring. Because if the water reached those features then it absolutely will have traveled to other areas the full extent of the water paths need ot be evaluated.
• Clean, disinfect, and/or remediate all areas as necessary.

Water damage from leaks, flooding, sewage, and condensation has perhaps the most negative impact on health of occupants, with later damage to materials and contents of buildings. Left unresolved, water damage can create chronic health effects in people and weaken the structural integrity of buildings. 

A 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine, Damp Indoor Spaces and Health, identified potential health effects from growth of bacteria, mold, infestations of insects and rodents, plus the release of chemicals from the water damaged materials.  The 2008 AIHA book Recognition, Evaluation, and Control of Indoor Mold stated, in part: "moisture is the primary environmental condition associated with disease" and that the "prevention of unwanted moisture, and removal of filth caused by moisture, is necessary to prevent disease."

Flooding brings unknown contaminants into your home and can leave behind damage adjacent to the affected area that may not be visible. Even if the affected area was dried in less than 48 hours, if you have had a flood that brought significant water into your home, caused major damage, and/or you continue to notice moldy or musty odors we recommend a professional evaluation to verify any previous remediation of recent flooding was complete for all the damage and remediate additional areas if necessary. If not completely dried, cleaned, and remediated, the conditions can often remain as a trigger for symptoms and damage can get worse over time. Damaged furniture or other belongings may need to be professionally cleaned to sufficiently remove mold and other contaminants. Items that cannot be sufficiently cleaned should be discarded. 

General Principles of Managing Leaks and Restoration:
Addressing water damage of all types are basically the same. The specific details can be determined only by an on-site inspection and assessment. Whether the water source is from leaks, flooding, or sewage the fundamentals are below:

Evaluate the wet materials to determine if they are water damaged with mold growth or are only water stained. The latter can usually be dried and sufficiently cleaned. It is also important to clearly identify everywhere the water may have traveled. Water rarely stays where it started, spreading in often unpredictable ways, with additional damage around the perimeter and may not be visible. The following are necessary for a successful water damage remediation:

• The source of the water is identified and stopped.
• The previously wet building materials are comletely dried. 
• The previously wet materials have not been damaged beyond water stains. 
• None of the previously damp areas have what looks like visible mold growth.
• Check beyond the boundaries of what you know to have been wet for additional areas that got wet. Evaluate the areas around the leak for moisture with a pinless moisture meter (~$40). 
• Pay particular attention to where the water touched walls and cabinet supports, or cracks and seams in flooring. Because if the water reached those features then it absolutely will have traveled to other areas the full extent of the water paths need ot be evaluated.
• Clean, disinfect, and/or remediate all areas as necessary.

If all of the above have been verified, then typically nothing else is needed. However, if you indicated there are respiratory or other reactions with anyone in your family, then further investigation is necessary. Download the Moisture Action Plan.

Overly frequent vacuuming with a standard vacuum can increases reactivity.

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-561

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Frequent vacuuming may be keeping your carpet visibly cleaner, but you may be inadvertently making the air you breathe less clean. Carpets rarely need vacuuming more than once a week. Too frequent vacuuming also increases exposure to the "dust" disturbed by the action of vacuuming and, especially, exposure to the "dust" in the exhaust of standard vacuums. For any vacuuming, but especially if more than weekly is deemed necessary, use a vacuum with an upgraded filter on the exhaust. A HEPA filter on the exhaust is preferred, and often necessary for those with asthma, COPD, allergies, or other respiratory conditions.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

"House Dust" or "Carpet Dust" is a combination of all substances settled onto the surface of carpets and just below the surface. The sizes range from visible dust to the 99% of fine and ultra-fine particles that are too small to see. The smaller the particles, the deeper into the lungs they can go. Frequent irritation of the respiratory system, eyes, and throat can lead to increased susceptibility to inflammation, infection, and respiratory disease. Peer reviewed studies have also strongly associated inhalation of sub-PM2.5 particulate with cardiovascular disease. More recent studies have confirmed that ultra-fine particulate can physically enter the brain through the olfactory nerve pathway. The substances in "House Dust" can include common allergens, triggers for asthma, plus irritants for COPD and other respiratory conditions.

Standard vacuums (non-HEPA filtered) actually increase exposure to "dust" because the exhaust is not filtered, or is insufficiently filtered. This blows dust, which is not visible to the naked eye, right back into the room where it came from, and is easily and directly inhaled by the person doing the vacuuming. It can also be inhaled later because it stays airborne for minutes to hours, and further distributed throughout the house by normal convection currents and by forced air systems.

Frequent vacuuming may be good for your carpet, but not so good for you.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

If foot traffic and other activity on your carpet requires vacuuming more than once per week, we recommend switching from a standard vacuum to one with a filtered exhaust.  An upgraded exhaust filter, preferably HEPA (or near HEPA quality) will minimize your exposure to dust and particulates that are exhausted from standard vacuums.

Identifying the type of filtration on a vacuum cleaner can be challenging. There are many marketing claims that sound as good as, or even better than, HEPA filtered vacuums. For example, some vacuum bags use the word "HEPA," but cannot perform to the required specification of a "HEPA" filter. Other bags may claim 99% or "total" removal of common allergens and pollen.  However, even cheap bags can remove those large particles. A legitimate HEPA filter on a vacuum, or in an air cleaner, will clearly contain these words: "99.97% at 0.3 micron" particles. (NOTE: the words "down to" or "as small as" do NOT mean the same as the word "at.")

Bag-less vacuums also need a filter on the exhaust.

Replace bags and filters, and empty the bagless containers, outside the living area. This prevents introducing the "dirt" right back into the room it just came from. Do so carefully to prevent exposure from the inhalation of the "dust" as it is removed.

Central vacuuming systems must be exhausted away from the living areas.

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-566

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Too frequent vacuuming may be keeping your carpet visibly cleaner but they rarely need vacuuming more than once a week. Too frequent vacuuming increases exposure to the "dust" disturbed from the carpet by the action of vacuuming.

The benefit of a central vacuum system is it does not exhaust inside the room like a traditional vacuum. Instead, it exhausts outside of the other living spaces, often into the garage.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

The power head of any type of vacuum cleaner disturbs the dust and debris in the carpet, some of which escapes around the edges before it can be sucked into the hose. Too frequent vacuuming increases the risk of inhaling that "dust."

Dust is typically a combination of fine and ultra-fine particles. The smaller the particles, the deeper into the lungs they can go. Continued irritation of the respiratory system, eyes, and throat can lead to increased susceptibility to inflammation, infection, and respiratory disease. Peer reviewed studies have also strongly associated inhalation of sub-PM2.5 particulate with cardiovascular disease. More recent studies have confirmed that ultra-fine particulate can physically enter the brain through the olfactory nerve pathway. Dust is also a common allergen and and trigger for asthma.

Central vacuums, however, remove the risk of "dust" in the exhaust returning into the room where it was just removed. However, care must be taken to insure the exhaust is either outside the house or in the garage (away from any forced air systems, vents, or other air pathways into the house).

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Vacuuming once a week is generally sufficient for cleaning.

Because central vacuums do not exhaust into the air of the room being cleaned, there is less exposure to the "dust" and dirt than from a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filtered exhaust. However, central vacuum systems do have an exhaust port. Care must be taken to make sure the vacuum doesn't exhaust directly into the living space, or inadvertently into air pathways which flow back into the living space.

Ideally the vacuum exhausts outside, but this is usually not practical. If it exhausts into the garage or basement, make sure it does have a reasonable filter and the air flow is away from forced air systems, ducts, or other vents which may allow the dust to migrate back into the house through air pathways.

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Roaming robot vacuums can only clean the top surface of carpets efficiently. A HEPA vacuum with power head is required for complete cleaning.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Dust is typically a combination of fine and ultra-fine particles. The smaller the particles, the deeper into the lungs they can go. Continued irritation of the respiratory system, eyes, and throat can lead to increased susceptibility to inflammation, infection, and respiratory disease. Peer reviewed studies have also strongly associated inhalation of sub-PM2.5 particulate with cardiovascular disease. More recent studies have confirmed that ultra-fine particulate can physically enter the brain through the olfactory nerve pathway. Dust is also a common allergen and and trigger for asthma.

Roaming vacuums can only remove dust and dirt from the surface of carpet leaving much of the embedded dust and dirt under the surface. While vacuuming daily or 3x a week is usually excessive, that is not the case with a roaming vacuum because even constant running will not increase the depth of the cleaning. In addition, the air that is exhausted from the vacuum cleaner needs to be filtered or it needs to exhausted to a location outside the living space. So while it seems that vacuuming constantly is good for you home, you may be cleaning less than you think and think and inadvertently be putting a lot of dust back into the room and the air you breathe.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Your roaming vacuum works well on smooth surfaced flooring and for capturing dust and dirt on the surface of carpet. This is not deep cleaning and will result in dust and dirt becoming embedded into the the carpet and pad over time. We recommend deep and thorough cleaning of your carpet by adding an additional vacuum cleaner that has a power head for deep cleaning. Because it will remove more dust and dirt than the roaming device, use one with an enhanced exhaust filter, preferably a HEPA or near HEPA filter.

Continue using your roaming vacuum for visual aesthetic  reasons, but use your other device at least weekly.

Vacuum more frequently or upgrade your vacuum


Infrequent vacuuming with a standard vacuum cleaner cannot keep carpets clean.

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Vacuuming less than weekly cannot keep carpets clean. One result is that when you do vacuum with a standard vacuum cleaner, an increased amount of dust and dirt is pulled out of the carpet and exhausted back into the room. Vacuum more often but upgrade your vacuum cleaner.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

The less frequently the carpet has been maintained with routine weekly vacuuming, the greater the amount of impacted dirt. This "dirt" is composed of particles from the air - which contain more than simple "house dust" - plus fragments of old carpet fibers. But the greatest concern is what is tracked onto carpets over the years. This can contain not just ordinary dirt but everything else shoes have stepped in. Over time, normal walking on the carpet will push this debris below the carpet surface into the deepest layers of the carpet base. Some will even penetrate the base and be pushed into and below the carpet pad, the lowest layers of which are beyond the reach of even the most vigorous cleaning methods. At the same time, however, normal walking on the carpet will disturb the impacted dirt, pushing some of the smallest particles back into the air where they can be inhaled.

Small children and infants spend much of their time on the floor, increasing their exposure to the entire mixture of inhalable "dirt."

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

An upgraded exhaust filter, preferably HEPA (or near HEPA quality) will minimize your exposure to dust and particulates that are exhausted from standard vacuums.

Identifying the type of filtration on a vacuum cleaner can be challenging. There are many marketing claims that sound as good as, or even better than, HEPA filtered vacuums. For example, some vacuum bags use the word "HEPA," but cannot perform to the required specification of a "HEPA" filter. Other bags may claim 99% or "total" removal of common allergens and pollen.  However, even cheap bags can remove those large particles. A legitimate HEPA filter on a vacuum, or in an air cleaner, will clearly contain these words: "99.97% at 0.3 micron" particles. (NOTE: the words "down to" or "as small as" do NOT mean the same as the word "at.")

Bag-less vacuums also need a filter on the exhaust.

Replace bags and filters, and empty the bagless containers, outside the living area. This prevents introducing the "dirt" right back into the room it just came from. Do so carefully to prevent exposure from the inhalation of the "dust" as it is removed.

Increase your vacuuming frequency

Infrequent vacuuming with a central vacuum cleaner cannot keep carpets clean.

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

e-581

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Vacuuming less than weekly cannot keep carpets clean, especially in high-traffic areas.

The benefit of a central vacuum system is they do not exhaust inside the room like a traditional vacuum. Instead, it exhausts outside of the other living spaces, often into the garage.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

The less frequently the carpet has been maintained by routine vacuuming, the greater the amount of impacted dirt. Monthly or rarely vacuuming cannot remove dirt faster than it can be tracked in, especially in high-traffic areas or when there are pets.

Dirt tracked onto carpets over the years can contain not just the ordinary dirt but everything else shoes have stepped in. Over time, normal walking on the carpet will push this debris below the carpet surface into the deepest layers of the carpet base. Some will even penetrate the base and be pushed into and below the carpet pad. These are beyond the reach of even the most vigorous cleaning methods. Particles from the air - which also contain more than simple "house dust" - have settled onto the carpet surface where it, too, is pushed below the surface and is part of the impacted dirt which cannot be sufficiently removed.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

Central vacuums do not exhaust into the air of the room, which is better than a HEPA filtered vacuum, but care must be taken to make sure the vacuum doesn't exhaust into the living space. This is especially important if you vacuum less than weekly as it raises the likelihood that large amounts of dust can re enter the room.

Start by determining where your central vacuum system is located. Ideally the vacuum exhausts outside. If it exhausts into the garage or basement, make sure it is away from forced air systems, ducts, or other vents which may allow the dust to migrate back into the house through air pathways.

We understand relocating the central vacuum location is not possible but changing your bag regularly can reduce particulate emission from the unit and increase capture efficiency at the carpet. Your system may have HEPA, "near-HEPA", or allergy reducing filters or bags for your unit. If your vacuum exhaust is connected to the indoors see if the unit has an upgraded filter or bag.

Vacuuming once a week is generally sufficient for cleaning, but adjust as necessary for your home's conditions and personal sensitivity.

Vacuuming once or twice a week is usually sufficient to keep carpets clean. But a standard vacuum exhausts dust back into the room where it can be easily inhaled or resettle back onto the carpet.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

Routinely vacuuming carpet once or twice a week is an excellent way to maintain your carpet by removing dust, dirt, and other particulates before they can accumulate. However, if your vacuum is not upgraded to a filtered exhaust, preferably with a HEPA or "near-HEPA" filter, the fine and ultra-fine particles will blow back into the room where they can be inhaled by occupants and resettle onto surfaces and the carpet.

"House Dust" or "Carpet Dust" is a combination of all substances settled onto the surface of carpets and just below the surface. The sizes range from visible dust to the 99% of fine and ultra-fine particles that are too small to see. The smaller the particles, the deeper into the lungs they can go. Frequent irritation of the respiratory system, eyes, and throat can lead to increased susceptibility to inflammation, infection, and respiratory disease. Peer reviewed studies have also strongly associated inhalation of sub-PM2.5 particulate with cardiovascular disease. More recent studies have confirmed that ultra-fine particulate can physically enter the brain through the olfactory nerve pathway. The substances in "House Dust" can include common allergens, triggers for asthma, plus irritants for COPD and other respiratory conditions.

Standard vacuums (non-HEPA filtered) actually increase exposure to "dust" because the exhaust is not filtered, or is insufficiently filtered. This blows dust, which is not visible to the naked eye, right back into the room where it came from, and is easily and directly inhaled by the person doing the vacuuming. It can also be inhaled later because it stays airborne for minutes to hours, and further distributed throughout the house by normal convection currents and by forced air systems.

Frequent vacuuming may be good for your carpet, but not so good for you.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

An upgraded exhaust filter, preferably HEPA (or near HEPA quality) will minimize your exposure to dust and particulates that are exhausted from standard vacuums.

New carpet may need reduction of chemical odor.

-------------------------------------------E-External Title-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-External ID-------------------------------------------

e-596

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

New carpets have fresh chemicals from the manufacturing process and may need special treatment to reduce reactions from the odor and chemical exposure from off-gassing.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

New carpets contain a mix of chemicals from the manufacturing process which includes dyes and the adhesive holding the fibers to the backing.  The carpet backing itself has a well known off-gassing chemical identified a 4-PC, which is the typical "new carpet smell." Stain resistance or "protection" can include any of an increasing variety of chemicals. Some carpets, especially natural fibers, can be required to have added flame retardants, another group of an increasing variety of chemicals.

Many of these chemicals are linked to upper respiratory tract and eye irritation, skin rashes, and allergic reactions. Others are associated with nervous system irritation, "brain fog," or other cognitive effects.

Those who already experience symptoms of chemical intolerance are at even higher risk. Occasionally, the types and amounts of chemicals evaporating from new carpets can sensitize an otherwise tolerant individual. Exposure can also be significant for babies and toddlers who breathe faster, have smaller body mass, and spend more time on the floor.

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

The odors from chemicals cannot be directly removed, but many can be significantly reduced by increasing their evaporation rate (off-gassing) of the carpet fibers.

Carpet cleaning with hot water extraction can be an effective method for reducing the "new carpet smell." This application uses the same carpet cleaning units that can be rented from hardware or grocery stores             (NOTE: Thoroughly flush the tank and hoses of rented equipment to remove all remnants of odor and fragrance from previous cleaning solutions).

The use of plain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hot</span> water with a small amount of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-fragranced</span> cleaning solution works in three ways:
1. The heat of the water accelerates evaporation.
2. The extracted hot water itself can dissolve many of the chemicals.
3. Although new carpets are clean, the extracted hot water will remove the small fibers and fragments remaining from the manufacturing process.

Hot water extraction will not reduce odors and chemicals from the carpet backing, the carpet pad, or any adhesives holding the carpet to the floor. Adding ventilation by using exhaust fans, or just opening windows, will reduce the accumulation of the evaporated gasses, but may not provide significant enough reduction. Another method, commonly called a "bake-out," increases the temperature of the entire house (or individual rooms with new carpet) and can often help, but has limited success with new carpet.

Old carpet may have too much impacted dirt and be too deteriorated to sufficiently clean.

e-601

-------------------------------------------E-External ID-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Summary-------------------------------------------

Old carpet may be too full of years of deeply impacted dirt to be sufficiently cleaned by either vacuuming or carpet cleaning. Old carpet can also be too deteriorated to withstand the aggressive cleaning methods necessary for effective cleaning. We recommend replacement with smooth-surfaced flooring.

-------------------------------------------E-Summary-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

The less frequently the carpet has been maintained with routine weekly vacuuming, the greater the amount of impacted dirt. This "dirt" is composed of particles from the air - which contain more than simple "house dust" - plus fragments of old carpet fibers. But the greatest concern is what is tracked onto carpets over the years. This can contain not just ordinary dirt but everything else shoes have stepped in. Over time, normal walking on the carpet will push this debris below the carpet surface into the deepest layers of the carpet base. Some will even penetrate the base and be pushed into and below the carpet pad, the lowest layers of which are beyond the reach of even the most vigorous cleaning methods. At the same time, however, normal walking on the carpet will disturb the impacted dirt, pushing some of the smallest particles back into the air where they can be inhaled.

Small children and infants spend much of their time on the floor, increasing their exposure to the entire mixture of inhalable "dirt."

-------------------------------------------E-Why Is This Important-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------S-How-To-------------------------------------------

We recommend replacement of old carpets with smooth surface flooring.   But first, the deteriorated and contaminated carpet must be removed - carefully.

Vigorous removal of carpets and pads, which is routine practice for most carpet and flooring companies,  disturbs surface dust and breaks up the impacted "dirt," releasing significant particulate into the air - where it then settles onto the surfaces of contents, plus clings to walls and ceilings - putting right back into the room what was previously removed.

To minimize this risk when removing carpet, both you and the contractors should follow these general rules:
<ol>
 	<li>Lightly spray the top of the carpet with water, just enough to keep the surface dust from becoming airborne. -OR- Cover the carpet surface with a sheet of thin, inexpensive plastic, like painters plastic.</li>
 	<li>Cut the carpet into 3-4 foot wide manageable strips, then roll up the strips so they can be easily removed and disposed.</li>
 	<li>Slowly and carefully sweep the debris and then HEPA vacuum the dust from the floor before further work or disturbance of the exposed floor.</li>
</ol>
Additional precautions are recommended for those with asthma, COPD, or other respiratory conditions.
<ul>
 	<li>Turn off the forced air system and cover the vents.</li>
 	<li>Cover furniture in adjacent rooms.</li>
 	<li>Even better, cover doorways to adjacent rooms with plastic to prevent migration of the air from the source of "dust" into other areas.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New flooring  </strong>We recommend smooth surface flooring for easier cleanability. Reduce chemical exposure by using materials labeled as either zero- or low-VOC (volatile organic compounds). Wood laminates, vinyl, and the various glues, resins, and adhesives frequently contain formaldehyde and other VOCs. A word of caution about how products are labeled. Zero-VOC does not mean absolutely no VOCs are present. Not all VOCs are required by law to be identified. Those not required are legal and are why zero-VOC products still have a "smell," each of which will be different.

If you choose to install new carpet, select one that is low-pile for easier cleaning. Natural materials like wool, jute, hemp, and cotton don't have chemicals used in the creation of the material, but they are still treated with the additives for dyes for color, stain resistance, and fire retarding. Carpet pads require similar evaluation, as does the method for fastening the carpet to the floor.

Discovering the materials and chemicals in flooring products is beyond challenging. The best available source of independently verified information is the Life Cycle Assessment program (LCA) in the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) section. Limited but non-verified information can be found in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for all materials - except for the carpet itself.
